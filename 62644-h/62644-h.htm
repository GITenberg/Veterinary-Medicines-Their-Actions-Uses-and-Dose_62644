<h2 class="front">PREFACE</h2>

<p>There is no scarcity of excellent works on Veterinary
materia medica and Therapeutics.</p>

<p>Many of these will well repay the student for the
time spent in mastering them, but none seem to meet the
wants of the Veterinary Practitioner and Student for
whom this work is primarily intended.</p>

<p>It has been my endeavor to find, and bring together
in available form, some of the facts regarded as of value
to those upon whom the stockman must depend, to a
great extent, for important services when sickness comes
upon our dumb friends&mdash;the domestic animals.</p>

<p>A few publications have been consulted, and in some
instances quoted. It has not been practicable to give
proper credit for use of ideas and language in each instance,
but a general acknowledgment is here made.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY OF VETERINARY MATERIA
MEDICA, THERAPEUTICS AND
TOXICOLOGY</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Materia Medica</span>, derived from two <i>Latin</i> words
signifying medical material, the science which treats
with medicine, their source or origin, their derivatives,
physical and chemical properties, their method of preparation
and administration, their dose, physiological and
toxicological effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Therapeutics</span>, derived from the Greek, <i>Therapevo</i>,
meaning to serve or attend the sick, is that branch of
knowledge which treats of the application of all means&mdash;medical
or otherwise&mdash;to the cure of disease or relief of
pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toxicology</span>, derived from the Greek <i>Toxikon</i>, a
poison, is that branch of knowledge which treats of the
nature, actions, detection and treatment of poisons.</p>

<p>A <i>medicine</i> is an agent of animal, vegetable, or mineral
origin used for the cure of disease or relief of pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drug</span>, derived from the Dutch, <i>Droog</i>, meaning dry,
is now used synonymously with medicine although
originally referring to an herb or dried medical plant.</p>

<h2>GENERAL ACTIONS OF MEDICINES</h2>

and apparent life, except breathing and the action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
heart. They comprise Nitrous Oxide Gas, Ether and
Chloroform, etc.</p>

insects, as essential oils, powdered tobacco, sulphur
and naphthalin, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antiperiodic.</span>&mdash;A medicine that tends to prevent the
periodic recurrence of a disease, as Quinine Sulphate,
Arsenous Acid, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antiperistaltic or Antiperistalsis.</span>&mdash;Are medicines
that produce compression of peristalsis or the
worm-like movement of the intestines by which method
the alimentary canal propels its contents, as Opium.</p>

<h2>ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES</h2>

<p>The following methods of administering medicines
in order of their rapidity of absorption, beginning with
the method by which absorption is most rapid, and following
with those by which absorption is less rapid and
finally least rapid: 1. Intravenous, by injection into
veins. 2. By inhalation (volatile drugs). 3. Subcutaneous,
by injection into subcutaneous tissue. 4. Intratracheal,
by injection into the trachea (or wind pipe).
5. Oral, by the mouth. 6. Rectal, by the rectum. 7.
Inunction, by the skin. 8. Intramammary injections.</p>

<h2>WHEN MEDICINES SHOULD BE
ADMINISTERED</h2>

<p>The curative effects of medicines may be restrained,
changed in form or prevented by untimely administration.</p>

<p>Medicines intended to act on the mucous membrane
of the stomach should only be given when that organ is
empty. If distant parts are to be affected in the most
prompt and efficient manner and the medicine is free
from distinct irritating qualities, it should be taken on
an empty stomach; as when digestion is going on, the
contents of the stomach are acid in reaction and if
alkalies are given combinations take place and salts are
formed. If alkalies are given before digestion begins,
diffusion of the acid-forming constituents of the blood
takes place, and in this way the acidity of the gastric
juice is promoted; likewise acids given before meals increase
the diffusion of the alkaline constituents of the
blood.</p>

<h2>METHODS OF ADMINISTERING MEDICINES</h2>

<p>Drenching, bit, balling gun, capsule gun, bottle,
dose syringe and hypodermic syringe.</p>

<h2>THE ART OF PRESCRIBING</h2>

<p>The prescription should be as brief and simple as
possible. It should be explicit and clearly written. It
may be expressed either in Latin or in English. The
manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic
regulations or diet of the patient are sometimes
necessary.</p>

<p>Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the
following four representative constituents: (1) The
<i>basis</i> or active ingredients. The practice of conjoining
several active medicines has wisely been abandoned.
Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat
different ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are
more often effectually controlled by the conjunction of
a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium than
by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by
either morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving
them together. (2) The <i>adjuvant</i> is introduced in
order to increase, moderate or modify the action of the
basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure solubility
and ready absorption. (3) A <i>corrective</i> is occasionally
required to temper the effects of the basis. Thus a
small dose of opium is prescribed with oil or other laxative
in cases of diarrhoea; ginger is generally added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
the aloetic mass to prevent its griping. (4) The
<i>vehicle</i> generally consists of some comparatively inert
substance, added to facilitate administration, such as
the treacle, linseed meal or licorice powder used as an
excipient for boluses and pills, the benzoated lard or
vaseline used for making ointments, and the water given
in drenches.</p>

<h2>ACIDUM BORICUM&mdash;BORACIC ACID&mdash;BORIC
ACID</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by evaporation and crystallization
of a solution obtained by passing steam issuing from
rocks in volcanic regions of Italy, through water; or
by the action of hydrochloric or sulphuric acids upon
borax. Recovered by filtration and recrystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Transparent colorless scales, of a
somewhat pearly luster, six-sided tricline crystals, or a
light white, very fine powder, slightly unctuous to the
touch; odorless, having a faintly bitterish taste, and
permanent in air. Soluble in water, alcohol, glycerine,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 drs.; foals and
calves, 20 to 30 grs.; sheep and pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs,
5 to 20 grs.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>GLYCERITUM BOROGLYCERINI&mdash;GLYCERITE
OF BOROGLYCERIN</h4>

<p>Composed of boric acid, 310 parts; glycerin to make
1,000; prepared by heat (303° F.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Boric acid is a non-volatile, non-irritating
antiseptic, deodorant and astringent, it arrests fermentation
of minute organisms, free of irritating effects in
solution, when applied to wounds; it lessens suppuration,
and is as effective as carbolic acid; can be used in
any strength from the pure powder or saturated solution
to the mildest form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Boric acid is indicated for all purposes for
which an antiseptic is used; it is used in diarrhoea in
foals, calves and dogs, combined with other drugs; it
has a slightly astringent action of itself; it is excreted in
the urine, consequently would exert its influence on the
bladder in cystitis, cystic catarrh; 1 part in 800 prevents
the development of anthrax-bacilli; useful in skin
diseases, also used in keratitis and catarrhal and purulent
conjunctivitis, six to ten grains to the ounce, with
atropine or cocaine when very painful. Useful in distemper<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
of dogs where the bowels are affected, as an antiseptic.
Boric acid is preferred to carbolic acid as an
antiseptic for dogs. On account of the paralyzing effect
of carbolic acid on the nerves, it hinders the healing
of wounds to a certain extent, while the boracic acid does
not.</p>

<p>Boric acid may be applied pure to wounds and sores
or mixed with other suitable drugs as a dusting powder.
Equal parts of boric acid and zinc oxide make a cheap
and effective healing powder; to an itching wound the
addition of an equal quantity of acetanilide increases its
value. A saturated solution (four per cent) is useful
as a vaginal and uterine douche and to flush the bladder
in cystitis.</p>

<h2>ACIDUM CARBOLICUM CRUDUM&mdash;CRUDE
CARBOLIC ACID</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A liquid consisting of several different
constituents of coal tar, particularly creosol and
phenol, obtained by fractional distillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A nearly colorless, or reddish-brown
liquid of a strong disagreeable and creosote-like odor,
and gradually turning darker on exposure to the air and
light. Soluble in fifteen parts of water.</p>

<h2>PHENOL&mdash;ACIDUM CARBOLICUM&mdash;CARBOLIC
ACID</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained from crude carbolic acid by
agitation with caustic soda, heating to 338° F., and adding
hydrochloric acid. Then by agitation with sodium
chloride, digestion with calcium chloride, and distillation
at a temperature between 336° F. and 374° F. and
finally by crystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Phenol in its pure state is a solid at
ordinary temperatures, crystallizing in minute plates or
long rhomboidal needles, white or colorless, of a
peculiar odor recalling that of creosote, and an acrid
burning taste. It is likely to be colored pinkish or brown
under the influence of light and air. Soluble in about<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
19.6 parts of water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether,
chloroform, glycerin, fixed and volatile oils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Phenol in large and undiluted doses is
an irritant and narcotic poison; it is used as an antiseptic,
parasiticide, antiferment and sometimes used as a local
anaesthetic or anodyne in a 2 to 5 per cent solution; also
as a caustic, but should not be used as a caustic as a burn
from it heals very slowly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Internally as a gastric sedative in small doses
for vomiting in dogs; is administered in various contagious
and infectious diseases with the view of preventing
or arresting the development of micro-organisms; it
coagulates albumen, is not nearly so active as bichloride
of mercury; 1 part to 500 parts of water prevents the
growth of anthrax and other bacilli. Full doses produce
gastro-enteritis, and collapse, which may end fatally;
it is a muscular and nerve paralyzer, both internally
and externally, it kills by paralyzing the muscles of
respiration and the heart. It is chiefly eliminated from
the system by the kidneys, giving the urine a brownish
color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Surgery.</span>&mdash;A three to five per cent solution is
used for washing out wounds, a two to three per cent
for hands, and for itching of the skin, carbolic acid
three or four drachms, glycerine two ounces to one pint
of water. Do not use over large surface on dogs and
not at all on cats.</p>

<p>Phenol treatment for Tetanus, which has given very
good results and I would recommend one drachm in
three ounces of water, injected hypodermically in the
region of neck and shoulder every two or three hours
until twelve injections were given and less frequently
thereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Of the phenol: Horses and cattle, 10 to
40 grs.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 grs.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 gr.,
well diluted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toxicology.</span>&mdash;Dogs and cats are especially susceptible
to the action of carbolic acid, therefore great care<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
must be exercised when washing, especially cats, with
any preparation containing carbolic acid. Disinfecting
and deodorizing cat’s quarters with any preparation containing
carbolic acid makes them sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antidote.</span>&mdash;Sulphates of soda or magnesia. Atropine
sulphate hypodermically is a very valuable antidote.
Alcohol and vinegar have been used with good results,
both internally and externally.</p>

<h2>ACIDUM SALICYLICUM&mdash;SALICYLIC ACID</h2>

<p>An organic acid, existing naturally in combination
in various plants, but largely prepared synthetically
from carbolic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by passing carbonic dioxide
through sodium carbolate at a temperature of 428° F.
(220° C.). 2 NaC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O (sodium carbolate) + CO<sub>2</sub> =
Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (sodium salicylate) + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O (phenol).
Sodium salicylate is treated with hydrochloric acid when
salicylic acid is precipitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Light, fine, white, needle-shaped
crystals, odorless, having a sweetish, afterwards acrid
taste; permanent in air. Soluble in alcohol, ether and
hot water; borax increases its solubility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 to 6 drs.; cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep,
1 to 2 drs.; pigs, 30 to 40 grs.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.; should
be given well diluted; large doses are recommended for
fevers, but smaller doses more often repeated in rheumatism.</p>

<h2>SODII SALICYLAS&mdash;SODIUM SALICYLAS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by the action of salicylic acid
on sodium carbonate. The solution is filtered and
heated to expel carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white amorphous or crystalline
powder or scales; odorless and having a sweetish, saline
taste. Permanent in air. Soluble in water, alcohol and
glycerine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as for salicylic acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span></p>

<h2>PHENYLIS SALICYLAS&mdash;PHENYL SALICYLATE
(Salol)</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by heating salicylic and carbolic
acids with phosphorous pentachloride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white crystalline powder; odorless,
or having a faintly aromatic odor, and almost tasteless.
Permanent in air. Insoluble in water, soluble in
ten parts of alcohol and readily soluble in chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as for salicylic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Salicylic acid, sodium salicylate and
phenyl salicylate are powerful antiseptic, anti-rheumatic,
diaphoretic, cardiac depressant, antiferment and
antipyretic. Salicylic acid is in addition irritant and
astringent, continued in large doses is apt to derange
digestion; best to be administered on a full stomach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;For acute rheumatism, influenza, strangles
and purpura where there is much sloughing; also as a
surgical wash, salicylic acid one part, borax one part to
thirty or forty parts of water. Salicylic acid is a more
powerful antiseptic than carbolic acid. Salicylic of soda
is freely antiseptic. Salicylic acid is highly recommended
in intestinal flatulence, given in two drachm
doses with one ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia.
In gastric-flatulence give two drachms in capsule, repeat
in half hour if necessary.</p>

<h2>ACONITUM&mdash;ACONITE&mdash;MONKSHOOD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Aconite is obtained from the root of
aconitum napellus, which grows in Northwestern North
America, Europe and Asia in mountainous regions, and
cultivated in the United States for its beautiful flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;The fresh leaves have a faint narcotic
odor, most sensible when they are rubbed. Their taste
is at first bitterish and herbaceous, afterwards burning
and acrid, with a feeling of numbness and tingling on
the inside of the lips, tongue and fauces, which is very
durable, lasting sometimes many hours. When long
chewed they inflame the tongue. The dried leaves have<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
a similar taste, but the acrid impression commences later.
Their sensible properties and medical activity are impaired
by long keeping. They should be of a green
color, and free from mustiness. The root has a feeble
earthy odor. Though sweetish at first, it has afterwards
the same effect as the leaves upon the mouth and fauces.
It shrinks much in drying and becomes darker, but
does not lose its acrimony. Those parcels, whether of
leaves or roots, should always be rejected which are
destitute of this property. Aconite root is officially
described as being “slenderly conical, 4 to 10 cm. long,
10 to 20 mm. thick at the crown; occasionally split; longitudinally
wrinkled; dark brown and marked with coarse
whitish root-scars; fracture short, horny or mealy; internally
whitish or light brown; the cambium zone irregular
and 5 to 7-angled; odor very slight; taste sweetish,
soon becoming acrid and developing a tingling sensation,
followed by numbness.”</p>

<p>Preparations of the leaves are not official in the U. S.
P. The root is five times stronger than the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;The alkaloid representing the action
of the drug is aconitine, which is precipitated by ammonia
from an aqueous solution of an alcoholic extract of
the root of various species. It is a colorless, crystalline
or amorphous, gray powder, almost insoluble in water,
and soluble in 22 parts of alcohol, in 44 parts of ether
and 1 part of chloroform. Its salts are soluble in water.
Aconitine or its solutions, unless very dilute, are too
poisonous to be tasted.</p>

<p>Commercial preparations vary in purity and
strength, and since it is extremely poisonous its internal
administration is undesirable. Pseudo-aconitine, aconitine
and other alkaloids in combination with aconitic
acid have been obtained from aconite, but their identity
and chemistry are uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 3 to 20 grs.; sheep and

OF ACONITE</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with alcohol
and water and evaporation. Assayed so that each 100
c. c. contains 0.4 gm. aconitine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 5 to 20 m.; sheep and

<p>Made by maceration and percolation of aconite, 100;
with alcohol and water to make 1000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 20 m. to 1 dr.; sheep and

<p>Fleming’s Tincture (non-official) (79 per cent).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 8 to 20 m.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to
2 m.</p>

<h4>ACONITINA&mdash;ACONITINE</h4>

<p>Not used to any extent in veterinary practice; is very
unreliable and varying in strength. Aconitine often
contains a considerable proportion of aconite and benzaconine,
and so varies in activity, which is a great objection
to the use of one of the most powerful drugs
known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> gr.; dogs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> gr. subcutaneously.</p>

<p>Actions of aconite, its preparations and derivative
are anodynes and sedatives, acting specially on the peripheral
endings of the sensory nerves, on the heart and
on respiration. Aconite kills by respiratory arrest.</p>

<p>Its physiological actions as a cardiac and respiratory
sedative renders it a febrifuge; it is also diaphoretic and
diuretic. It is prescribed in acute febrile conditions,
and in the earlier stages of acute local inflammation.
It is used topically to relieve pain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Actions.</span>&mdash;Locally applied, in virtue of its
action on sensory nerves, aconite produces first irritation,
tingling and twitching and subsequently numbness
and anesthesia. The tincture of aconite is rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
absorbed and quickly passed into the tissues, as is shown
by the blood of a poisoned dog five minutes after the
drug has been administered, being transferred into the
veins of another dog without producing the physiological
action of the poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toxic Effects.</span>&mdash;One and one-half drachm of the
tincture (equal to about one drachm of aconite root) is
given as the minimum fatal dose for the horse, one-half
drachm will occasionally cause very serious symptoms
and where an idiosyncrasy exists as little as fifteen
minims will cause toxic symptoms.</p>

<p>It causes great muscular weakness, dimness of sight;
pupil at first may be dilated or contracted, but as the
end approaches remains dilated; shallow irregular and
labored respiration, a slow and small pulse, becoming
rapid and imperceptible near the end. Gulping, frothy
saliva, flatulence, belching, retching, nausea, etc. There
is often a peculiar clicking sound made from the constant
attempts at swallowing.</p>

<p>Coldness of surface, clammy sweat, anxious countenance,
extreme weakness of the extremities, lowering
of temperature 2 to 3 degrees, abolishment of sensation,
reflexes and motility and finally death from paralysis
of the heart and respiration, with or without convulsions,
consciousness being preserved until near the end, when
carbon dioxide narcosis sets in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It antagonizes the fever process, when properly
used is a most valuable drug; it is indicated in all
affections, characterized by high resisting pulse, dry,
hot skin and elevated body temperature; is useful in
acute throat affections as laryngitis, pharyngitis and
perotiditis, in small doses often repeated. Indicated in
acute inflammation of the organs of respiration. For
pleurisy and perotiditis, at the outset, give aconite
with opium. Aconite is indicated in simple fevers or
in puerperal fever, inflammation of the brain; in acute
or inflammatory rheumatism, in acute local inflammation,
as arthritis or inflammation resulting from bruises,
sprains, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span></p>

<p>In lymphangitis, laminitis and enteritis, if called in
first stages of enteritis give 20 ms. of aconite and repeat
with 10 or 15 ms. every hour and between times gives
fluid extract of belladonna 15 to 20 ms. every hour and
externally woolen blankets wrung out of hot water and
wrapped around the body.</p>

<p>In mammitis is also useful in large doses, combined
with phytolacca; in spasmodic colic brought on by drinking
cold water, give 30 to 60 ms. of the tincture of aconite
with other colic mixture; in congestion of the bowels
or liver, or in congestion of any part, small repeated
doses are better than large ones. It is also advantageously
used in lung disorders.</p>

<h2>AETHER&mdash;ETHER&mdash;PURE ETHER</h2>

<p>A liquid composed of about 96 per cent, by weight,
of absolute ether or ethyl oxide, and about 4 per cent of
alcohol containing a little water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Prepared by distillation of alcohol
with sulphuric acid. There are two steps in the production
of ether; sulphorvinic acid and water are formed
in the first step. Sulphorvinic acid is then further acted
upon by alcohol. The distillate is freed from water by
agitation with calcium oxide and chloride and subjected
to redistillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A transparent, colorless, mobile liquid,
having a characteristic odor and a burning and
sweetish taste. Ether is highly volatile and inflammable;
its vapor, when mixed with air and ignited, explodes
violently. Miscible in all proportions with alcohol,
chloroform, benzine, benzol, fixed and volatile oils.
Ether is a solvent for fats, oils, alkaloids, resins, gutta
percha and guncotton. Upon evaporation ether should
have no residue. Ether vapor is heavier than air and
consequently etherization should never be done above a
light or fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 drs.; dogs, 10 ms. to 1 dr.</p>

<p>As an anaesthetic, horses and cattle require from 4
to 16 ozs. Smaller animals from 4 drs. to 4 ozs. Chloroform<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
is usually prescribed for large animals and ether
for smaller animals. Ether never paralyzes a healthy
heart, while chloroform sometimes does. For anaesthetic
purposes see anesthesia.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>SPIRITUS AETHERIS&mdash;SPIRIT OF ETHER</h4>

<p>Composed of ether, 325 parts, alcohol to make 1000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as ether.</p>

<h4>SPIRITUS AETHERIS COMPOSITUS&mdash;COMPOUND
SPIRIT OF ETHER&mdash;HOFFMAN’S
ANODYNE</h4>

<p>Composed of ether, 325 parts; alcohol, 650 parts;
ethereal oil, 25 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as for ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Ether is anodyne, antispasmodic, diaphoretic,
anthelmintic; a cardiac, respiratory and cerebral
stimulant, an anesthetic and a narcotic poison;
one of the best and quickest acting, diffusible, general
stimulants, acting on the heart reflexly from the stomach.
It is a powerful secretory stimulant, acting especially
on the secretions of the stomach, salivary glands
and pancreas. On the cerebrum and the motor and
sensory nerves, its actions are similar to that of alcohol,
but more prompt and less protracted; it is eliminated
quickly, chiefly by the lungs.</p>

<p>When inhaled, it first causes irritation of the fauces,
a sense of strangulation and cough, then a stage of excitement
in which the visible mucous membranes are
flushed and the respiration and pulse quickened; a convulsive
stage generally follows, with rigid muscles and
respiration stertorous; this subsides and complete insensibility
is established, the muscles being relaxed and
the reflexes abolished; in fact all of the functions of the
body are suspended, except respiration and circulation.</p>

<p>If the inhalation be continued these too become paralyzed,
death usually resulting from slow paralysis of
respiration (chloroform paralyzes quickly); the heart
pulsating long after breathing has ceased. Atropine<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
hypodermically is the best antagonist to the toxic effects
of ether, also artificial respiration and injections of
brandy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses of Ether.</span>&mdash;When mixed with alcohol, as the
spirit, ether mixes readily with water. It is excellent
in indigestion with flatulence; it checks gastric fermentation,
expels the gas and overcomes irregular and violent
gastro-intestinal movements; hence, is also very
good in spasmodic colic. In spasmodic colic, best to
combine with cannabis indica or belladonna. When used
as a vermifuge it should be followed by a purge. Used
diluted one to ten to dislodge worms in the rectum. A
most reliable remedy for collapse. Ether and alcohol
are indicated in parturient paresis, ether with aqua ammonia
may be used intravenously when the cow is unable
to swallow. Sulphuric ether and alcohol or whisky
are also good in parturient eclampsia of bitches, though
aromatic spirit of ammonia is better; for chills, spirit
of nitrous ether; also useful in convalescence from debilitating
disease. Ether is a very good remedy in Thumps.
Ether may be used for local anesthesia, applied as a
spray, from an atomizer, about one ounce, usually being
enough for the painless opening of abscesses or
fistulae, but cocaine is better in our patients. <i>As an
anesthetic</i> it should be used in preference to chloroform,
for the smaller and young animals, especially dogs,
which are easily killed by chloroform. Ether is less
prompt in action but much safer than chloroform, as it
never paralyzes a healthy heart; it should be inhaled in
as concentrated a form as possible, very little air being
allowed, so it will exert its effects quickly, in the dog;
a light or fire of any kind should not be allowed near, as
ether is very inflammable and its vapor explosive. Always
have a bottle of aqua ammonia fort. at hand as a
restorer.</p>

<h2>ALCOHOL</h2>

<p>Alcohol is derived directly from fruit sugar, and indirectly
from starch. The grains, as wheat, rye, corn;
and potatoes, supply starch most economically. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
starch in these substances is converted into glucose by
heating with very dilute sulphuric acid, or by fermentation
with malt. Glucose is further acted upon by
yeast containing the Torula cerevisiae, which converts 15
per cent of glucose into alcohol and carbonic dioxide.
The weak alcohol resulting is subjected to repeated distillation
until sufficiently pure and concentrated. In
the natural fermentation of fruit sugar in grape juice,
during the formation of wine, the amount of alcohol is
self-limited to 15, rarely 20 per cent, since the ferment is
killed by a larger amount of alcohol than this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The official alcohol is derived from
rectified spirits, by maceration, first with anhydrous potassium
carbonate, then freshly fused calcium chloride,
and finally by distillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A liquid composed of about 92.3 per
cent, by weight, or 94.9 per cent, by volume, of ethyl
alcohol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) and about 7.7 per cent, by weight,
of water (U. S. P.). A transparent, colorless, mobile
and volatile liquid, of a characteristic rather agreeable
odor and a burning taste. Specific gravity about .816
at 15.6° C. (60° F.). Miscible with water in all proportions
and without any trace of cloudiness. Also
miscible with ether chloroform. It is readily volatile
at low temperature, and boils at 78° C. (172.4° F.).
It is inflammable and burns with a blue flame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 3 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 1 to 2 dr. Diluted four to six times its
bulk of water.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>ALCOHOL ABSOLUTUM&mdash;ABSOLUTE
ALCOHOL</h4>

<p>Ethyl alcohol, containing not more than one per
cent, by weight, of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Percolation of the purest alcohol
through quicklime, out of contact with the air, and redistillation
in vacuo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Transparent, colorless, mobile and
volatile liquid, of a characteristic rather agreeable odor<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
and a burning taste. Very hydroscopic. Specific gravity
not higher than 0.797 at 15.6° C. (60° F.).</p>

<h4>SPIRITUS FRUMENTI&mdash;WHISKY</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;An alcoholic liquid obtained by the
distillation of the mash of fermented grain (usually of
mixtures of corn, wheat and rye) and at least four years
old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;An amber-colored liquid having a distinctive
odor and taste, and a slightly acid reaction. Its
specific gravity should not be more than 0.945, nor less
than 0.924, corresponding, approximately, to an alcoholic
strength of 37 to 47.5 per cent, by weight, or 44
to 55 per cent, by volume. Contains no more than
traces of fusel oil. The alcoholic liquors owe their flavor
to bouquet to ethers which are only developed in course
of time. The amylic alcohol, or fusel oil, in whisky is
therefore converted into ethers, which give the characteristic
flavor to whisky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and
swine, 1 to 2 oz.; dogs, 1 to 4 dr., diluted three to four
times its bulk in water.</p>

<h4>SPIRITS VINI GALLICI&mdash;BRANDY</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;An alcoholic liquid obtained by the
distillation of the fermented unmodified juice of fresh
grapes, and at least four years old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale amber-colored liquid, having a
distinctive odor and taste and a slightly acid reaction.
Its specific gravity should not be more than 0.941, nor
less than 0.925 at 15.6° C. (60° F.), corresponding, approximately,
to an alcoholic strength of 39 to 47 per
cent, by weight, or 46 to 55 per cent, by volume, of absolute
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as that for whisky.</p>

<h4>SPIRITUS JUNIPERI COMPOSITUS&mdash;COMPOUND
SPIRIT OF JUNIPER</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Oil of juniper, 8; oil of caraway, 1;
oil of fennel, 1; alcohol, 1,400; water to make 2,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span></p>

<p>Compound spirit of juniper is similar to gin in its
therapeutic action. Contains about 15 per cent more
alcohol. Gin is made by distillation of fermented malt
and juniper berries. Gin differs from the other alcoholic
preparations therapeutically in being more diuretic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as that for whisky.</p>

<h4>RUM (not official)</h4>

<p>Rum is made from a fermented solution of molasses
by distillation. It contains, by weight, from 40 to 50
per cent of absolute alcohol. Rum does not differ
physiologically from alcohol. There is no authoritative
Latin name for rum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as that for whisky.</p>

<h4>VINUM ALBUM&mdash;WHITE WINE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting
the juice of fresh grapes, the fruit of Vitis vinifera,
free from seeds, stems and skins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale amber or straw-colored liquid,
having a pleasant odor, free from yeastiness and a
fruity, agreeable, slightly spirituous taste, without excessive
sweetness or acidity. The Pharmacopoeia
(1890) directs that the wine should contain from 7 to
12 per cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol. California
Hock and Reisling, Ohio Catawba, Sherry, Muscatel,
Madeira or the stronger wines of the Rhine, Mediterranean
and Hungary come within the pharmacopoeial
limits. Wines containing more than 14 per cent
of alcohol are usually fortified, i. e., have alcohol or
brandy added to them, and much imported Sherry and
Madeira contain 15 to 20 per cent, by weight, of absolute
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as that for whisky.</p>

<h4>VINUM RUBRUM&mdash;RED WINE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;An alcoholic liquid made by fermenting
the juice of fresh colored grapes, the fruit of Vitis
vinifera, in presence of their skins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A deep red liquid, having a pleasant
odor, free from yeastiness, and a fruity moderately
astringent, pleasant and slightly acidulous taste, without
excessive sweetness or acidity. Should contain not
less than 7 nor more than 12 per cent, by weight, of
alcohol. Native Claret, Burgundy, Bordeaux and
Hungarian wines may be included within the pharmacopoeial
limits of vinum rubrum. Port (vinum portense)
is fortified with brandy during fermentation, and
contains 15 to 25 per cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol.
Port is astringent from tannic acid in the grapes,
skin and stalks, or the astringency may be due to logwood.
Red wines are said to be rough, contain tannic
acid and therefore are astringents. Dry wines are those
which contain little sugar. The wines develop ethers
with age and these improve their flavor and action.</p>

<p>Champagne contains about 10 per cent of absolute
alcohol and carbonic acid gas, which acts as a local
sedative upon the stomach. Ale, stout and beers contain
from 4 to 8 per cent of alcohol, together with bitters
and malt extracts.</p>

<p>Cider contains 5 to 9 per cent of absolute alcohol.
Imported sherry (B. P.) contains 15 to 20 per cent of
absolute alcohol.</p>

<p>Alcohol is the solvent most commonly employed in
pharmacy, dissolving alkaloids, resins, volatile oils, balsams,
oleo-resins, tannin, sugar, some fats and fixed oils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 3 to 6 oz.; sheep and pigs,
1 to 3 oz.; dogs, 2 dr. to 1 oz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Alcohol is a cerebral excitant and finally
becomes a depressant and a narcotic poison.</p>

<p>It is anesthetic, antiseptic, antiparasitic, rubefacient
(if confined), mild astringent, coagulate albumen; a
local refrigerant by virtue of its rapid evaporation, unless
confined by bandage, oiled silk, etc., when it is
absorbed by the tissues and causes a sensation of warmth.</p>

<p>In medical doses it is a powerful general stimulant;
it is very diffusible, and is partly oxidized by the organism,
and partly excreted; thus alcohol acts as a food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span></p>

<p>Small doses relax the blood vessels, stimulate the
gastric glands, promote appetite and digestion; lessen
the elimination of waste products, by preventing rapid
tissue waste; causes a feeling of warmth, and temporarily,
though slightly, raises the body temperature. It
stimulates the heart and increases the functional activity
of all organs, especially the kidneys and skin.</p>

<p>Large or too long continued doses derange the appetite
and digestion, congest or inflame the stomach and
liver. Eight ounces of alcohol killed a horse. Alcohol
is poisonous and should be used with caution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Are numerous, used principally as a stimulant,
either in one large dose, 2 to 3 ounces of alcohol,
or better, in small repeated doses, 1 ounce every 1, 2 or
3 hours, can be conjoined with other stimulants such
as sulphuric ether, aromatic spirits of ammonia, digitalis,
etc.</p>

<p>It is used in anesthetic mixtures, such as alcohol,
ether and chloroform, combined in different proportions;
in snake bites it is administered in very large
doses.</p>

<p>In blood poisoning alcohol is a most potent drug,
sustaining the heart, lowering the temperature and acting
as a germicide. Alcohol makes an excellent dressing
for wounds; applied locally to threatened bed-sores,
frequently prevents their formation. It is useful in
colds at their outset, or in a chill to restore the balance
of the circulation and prevent or overcome internal congestion
by relaxing the blood vessels of the periphery.</p>

<p>All alcoholic liquors are useful in debilitating diseases,
such as influenza, in two or three ounce doses repeated
every three or four hours. One-half to one
drachm of quinine to one ounce of alcohol, for influenza
or febrile diseases in general, excepting brain and spinal
disease; useful in convalescence. In colic alcohol can be
used with a great degree of success; it will act as a
carminative antispasmodic and stimulant, used in collapse
and weak heart; in septicaemia and pyaemia it has
notable antiseptic and antipyretic effects. Useful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
carbolic acid poisoning, alcohol, or alcoholic liquors, act
as a chemical antidote besides overcoming the shock
produced by the acid. It may also be used locally for
carbolic acid burns.</p>

<p>The effects of alcohol are noticed in ten or fifteen
minutes after administration and will be shown by a
better condition of the pulse, the weak pulse becoming
stronger and firmer; the quick pulse slower, the breathing
becomes more natural, eyes brighten up and in fact
a general improvement is shown.</p>

<p>Externally alcohol is used alone as a strengthening
application to weak tendons and muscles; or after a
race, is used to rub on the legs, combined with other
drugs as a liniment, as alcohol, soap-liniment and witch
hazel; can be used in surgery as an antiseptic.</p>

<p>To toughen the skin of tender or thin skinned horses
who gall or chafe easily under the collar and saddle,
alcohol will be found a most satisfactory application.</p>

dark ruby-red, fracture resinous. When moistened it
emits a fragrant saffron-like odor; taste peculiar, strongly
bitter. Almost entirely soluble in alcohol and four
parts of boiling water. The powdered socotrine aloes is
brighter and redder, and the odor less disagreeable than
that of Barbadoes Aloes.</p>

of bile; is also diuretic; applied externally it is stimulant
and desiccant; the Barbadoes is the most active and uniform
in its effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span></p>

<p>Aloes should be kept in lumps in tin cans or other
good containers, only powdered for immediate use; in
melting aloes don’t let the temperature rise above 120
degrees as it impairs the activity by converting the active
aloin into inert resin. Aloes operate in from 12 to
24 hours after administration; don’t repeat an aloetic
purge until 24 hours have elapsed. It also does not
cause catharsis. In about 15 hours, the patient should
be exercised, but returned to the stall as soon as the
desired effect is evident. If it fails to act in 24 hours,
linseed oil may be given. Aloin appears to contain the
active principles of aloes, and is usually as operative,
but some manufactures are ineffective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses Internal.</span>&mdash;In dyspepsia with capricious appetite,
irregularity of the bowels, hide-bound horses,
worms; is used in colic, both spasmodic and flatulent, for
overloaded condition of the bowels; to promote excretion
of waste products from the bowels and the blood, and
consequently relieve febrile symptoms; rheumatic attacks,
skin irritation, swollen limbs and inflamed joints;
in lymphangitis to prevent and aid in curing. By attracting
the blood to the bowels, it is useful in congestion
or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, full
doses being necessary; in paralysis, paraplegia or hemiplegia
or reflexed paralysis due to indigestion, give full
doses. Aloes should not be used in irritation or inflammation
of the alimentary canal or piles. It is not advisable
to give an aloetic purge when the temperature
is above 102° F. Nor in hemorrhage from the rectum;
in high fevers it is apt to cause superpurgation, also
should not be used where there is great debility or weakness.
In influenza the bowels are apt to be irritable and
oil is preferable to aloes. Don’t use during pregnancy;
may cause abortion. For young foals or other animals,
the gentler purgative, such as linseed or castor oil should
be used. The medical value of aloes being large, it is
impossible to enumerate all the diseases in which it is
useful. Externally the tincture of aloes and myrrh is
sometimes applied as a stimulant to wounds, and powdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
aloes is mixed with plaster of paris in making
splints for dogs to prevent these animals from biting
and tearing them off. Internally aloes should be combined
with ginger, nux vomica and given in capsule or
bolus.</p>

<h2>ALUMEN&mdash;ALUM</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;From alum slate, shale, schist, a native
mixture of aluminum silicate and iron sulphide.
This is roasted and exposed to the air, when the sulphur
is oxidized into sulphuric acid and combined in part with
aluminum and iron to form sulphates. The mass is
lixiviated with water, and aluminum and iron sulphates
together with sulphuric acid are recovered in solution.
The solution is concentrated and to it is added potassium
chloride. The double sulphate of potassium and aluminum
(alum) is formed, which crystallizes out on cooling,
while potassium sulphate and ferric chloride remain
as by-products. Alum is purified by recrystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Large, colorless, octahedral crystals,
sometimes modified by cubes or crystalline fragments;
without odor, but having a sweetish and strongly astringent
taste. On exposure to the air the crystals are liable
to absorb ammonia and acquire a whitish coating. Soluble
in nine parts of water, insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep and pigs,
20 gr. to 1 dr.; emetic for dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.</p>

<h3>ALUMEN EXSICCATUM&mdash;DRIED ALUM</h3>

<p>Commonly termed burnt alum, is alum deprived of
its water of crystallization by heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white granular powder, odorless,
having a sweetish astringent taste, soluble in twenty
parts of water at 60° F. Is a powerful astringent and
escharotic.</p>

<h3>ALUMINI HYDROXIDUM&mdash;ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made from alum, 100 parts; monohydrate
sodium carbonate, 43 parts; water, a sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
quantity. Mix hot, boiling solutions of alum and sodium
carbonate. Precipitate strained, washed and
dried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, light, amorphous powder;
odorless and tasteless; permanent in dry air; insoluble
in water or alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as alum.</p>

<h3>ALUMINI SULPHAS&mdash;ALUMINUM
SULPHATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Aluminum hydroxide is dissolved in
diluted sulphuric acid, and the solution is filtered and
evaporated to dryness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, crystalline powder, without
odor, having a sweetish and afterwards astringent
taste; permanent in the air; soluble in one part of water;
insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as alum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Astringent, at first excites flow of saliva,
then markedly decreases it; coagulates pepsin, thus it
would derange or entirely arrest digestion; it also stops
peristalsis and produces constipation, though sometimes
it induces diarrhoea by irritation. It arrests secretions
in general and in the circulation contracts the capillaries;
it is in this way it arrests secretions, especially those of
mucous surfaces, and stops capillary hemorrhage. The
sulphate of aluminum is mildly caustic, astringent and
antiseptic. Dried alum is caustic and astringent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Externally.</span>&mdash;Dried alum is a caustic, in contact
with raw sores, on account of its affinity for water.
Alum has no action on unbroken skin, but applied to
mucous membranes or denuded parts it is antiseptic and
astringent; coagulates albumin of discharges; precipitates
or coagulates albumin of the tissues; squeeze blood
out of the vessels; reduces inflammation and makes the
part whiter, brings together and denser. Alum is a
hemostatic, stopping bleeding by compression of the
structures surrounding the vessels and by causing blood
to clot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;In diarrhoea and dysentery, but other astringents<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
are safer and better, as it may lock the bowels too
tight, may be used in weeping sores or weeping skin
diseases; in long standing nail wounds by putting one-half
to one pound into the soaking tub, also in same
way for injured coronets, with raw bulging surfaces
that bleed easily, also for sore mouth, sometimes mix a
little boric acid; useful in bleeding piles, and in mild
solution alum one ounce to water one pint for sore
throat; also used internally for bloody urine (haematuria)
and for open joints apply the powdered alum to
arrest the flow of joint oil (synovia). For catarrhal
ophthalmia, after the acute stage, an alum lotion five
grains to one ounce of water is very serviceable; for
granular lids rub with a crystal of alum. Alum should
never be used too strong over the eye as it seems to
have the power of dissolving the cornea; a solution containing
ten grains of alum to the ounce of water may
be used in canker of the ear of dogs; also for leucorrhoea
and prolapsus of the rectum; dried alum may be used
as a caustic whenever a caustic is indicated, but is not
recommended for this purpose. For a powerful drying
powder, especially useful when excessive granulation
exists. It causes sloughing of the dead tissues and is
indicated when the use of the knife is inadmissible.</p>

<h2>AMYLIS NITRIS&mdash;AMYL NITRITE</h2>

<p>A liquid containing about 80 per cent of amyl nitrite,
together with variable quantities of undetermined compounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained through distillation of
nitric and amylic alcohol. Distillate purified by sodium
carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clear, yellow or pale yellow liquid,
oily, very volatile, peculiar and very diffusive ethereal
odor and a pungent aromatic taste. Insoluble in water,
but soluble in all proportions in alcohol, ether and
chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 5 to 15 ms.; dogs, 2 to 5 ms.; amyl nitrite is very
seldom given internally; hypodermically, one-half this<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
dose. By inhalation, same as given internally. It should
be fresh as it rapidly deteriorates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;It stimulates the heart’s action, greatly
dilates the arterioles by paralyzing their muscular coats;
causes a sense of fullness in the brain with vertigo, fall
of blood pressure due to dilation of the arterioles, lowering
of temperature; when the vapor is applied direct to
muscular or nerve tissues it suspends or completely arrests
its functional activity; it depresses the nervous
system and unstriped muscular fiber. Overdoses cause
death by respiratory failure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Epileptic attacks may be warded off by its
being inhaled; spasmodic asthma, used either internally,
hypodermically or best by inhalation; in strychnine poisoning,
angina pectoris in tetanus, and as a heart stimulant.
It is useful as an inhalation in bringing about
recovery from deep chloroform and anesthesia.</p>

<h2>ANISUM&mdash;ANISE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;The anise plant is a native of Egypt and
the Levant, but has been introduced in various parts of
that continent. It is also cultivated occasionally in the
gardens of this country. The fruit is abundantly produced
in Malta and Spain; in Romagna, in Italy, whence
it is largely exported through Leghorn, and in Central
and Southern Russia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;Ovoid, laterally compressed, 4 to 5
m. m. long; carpels usually cohering and attached to a
slender pedicel; grayish or greenish-gray to grayish
brown; each with a flat face and five light brown filiform
ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground,
this being the form in which it is usually used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 to 3 dr.; dogs, 10 to 30 gr.</p>

<h3>OLEUM ANISI&mdash;OIL OF ANISE</h3>

<p>A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless or pale yellow, thin and
strongly refractive liquid, having the characteristic odor<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
of anise, and a sweetish, mildly aromatic taste. Specific
gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an equal volume
of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and
pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs and cats, 1 to 5 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic
and carminative. It is used to relieve indigestion and
flatulence, to communicate an agreeable flavor to many
medicines, and to diminish the griping of purgatives.
Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or
alcohol to kill fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin;
and one drop of the pure oil may be placed on the
feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice. The oil of
anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of
drugs, and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant
properties.</p>

<p>The fruit is given all animals (generally powdered)
on their food&mdash;frequently with sodium bicarbonate and
ginger&mdash;to relieve mild forms of indigestion and flatulence
through its stomachic and carminative effects.</p>

<h2>ANTIMONII ET POTASSII TARTARS&mdash;ANTIMONY
AND POTASSIUM TARTRATE&mdash;TARTAR
EMETIC</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Make a white paste with cream of
tartar, antimony trioxide and water. Set aside 24 hours,
boil in water 15 minutes and crystallize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent crystals of the
rhombic system, becoming opaque and white on exposure
to the air, or a white granular powder without odor
and having a sweet, afterwards disagreeable, metallic
taste. Soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep, 2 to 5
gr.; pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr. As an
emetic for pigs, 4 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1 to 2 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Tartar emetic is a systemic and local
emetic, a diaphoretic, cardiac and arterial sedative and
a gastro-intestinal irritant. It is a powerful waste producer
and stimulates the secretions of the stomach, intestines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Large
doses cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, while toxic
doses are followed by vomiting (in animals that can
vomit), serious blood purging, great depression of the
circulation and respiration weakness, collapse and death.
Tartar emetic is also a vermifuge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Tartar emetic is too mild as an emetic in
poison cases. In asthma of dogs it may be used in
from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain doses to relax spasm and promote
secretion. For horses its most valuable use is to expel
the common round worms from the intestines, for which
it is very efficacious; given in two drachm doses once or
twice daily in the feed for four to six days, or one-half
ounce dissolved in water is given on an empty stomach
followed by a full dose of linseed oil.</p>

<h2>ANTIPYRINA&mdash;ANTIPYRIN</h2>

<p>Phenyl-hydrazine is acted upon by aceto-acetic ether,
when phenyl-monomethyl-pyrazolon, ethyl alcohol and
water results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, odorless, scaly crystals, of
a bitterish taste. Soluble in water, ether and chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 3 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 grs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Powerful antipyretic, anodyne and local
anesthetic, antiseptic, cardiac depressant; it reduces
temperature very quickly, usually within half an hour
and the effects continue two or more hours. It can
be administered by the mouth, hypodermically or intertracheally;
as an antiseptic it diminishes oxidation,
and promotes heat loss by dilating the cutaneous vessels,
but more probably by depressing the activity of the
calorifacient centers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Used in high fever where the temperature
must be reduced quickly, as in sun-stroke, acute rheumatism;
in man a solution of antipyrine from four to
ten per cent strength up, is sprayed into the nostrils for
hay-fever. Acetanilide is a better and safer and much
cheaper drug for febrile diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span></p>

<h2>AQUA AMMONIAE FORTIOR&mdash;STRONGER
AMMONIA WATER</h2>

<p>An aqueous solution of ammonia containing twenty-eight
per cent, by weight of the gas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Evolve ammonia gas by heating ammonium
chloride with calcium hydrate and pass it into
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless, transparent liquid, having
an excessively pungent odor and a caustic alkaline
taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 10 m. Should be diluted one
drachm to one pint of water.</p>

<h3>AQUA AMMONIAE&mdash;AMMONIA WATER</h3>

<p>An aqueous solution containing ten per cent by weight
of ammonia gas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Same as strong ammonia water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;The taste is not so caustic and the odor
is less pungent then the stronger water of ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 2 drs.; dogs, 10 to 20 m. Should be diluted
one drachm to half pint of water.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUS AMMONIAE&mdash;SPIRIT OF
AMMONIA</h3>

<p>An alcoholic solution containing ten per cent., by
weight of the ammonia gas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A solution of caustic ammonia in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless liquid, having a strong
odor of ammonia. This preparation of ammonia possesses
properties of ammonia and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 2 drs.; dogs, 10 to 20 m. Should be diluted
in water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span></p>

<h3>SPIRITUS AMMONIAE AROMATICUS&mdash;AROMATIC
SPIRIT OF AMMONIA</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Ammonium carbonate 3.4%, aqua ammonia
9%, oil of lemon 1%, oil of lavender flowers 0.1%,
oil of nutmeg 0.1%, alcohol 70%, and distilled water to
make 100 parts. Diluted in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A nearly colorless liquid when first
prepared, but gradually acquires an amber color. It has
a pungent ammoniacal odor and taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;These four proportions of ammonia are
gastric and general stimulants. They stimulate the cardiac
respiratory and spinal systems. They irritate the
nose when inhaled, but reflexly they stimulate the circulation
and respiration, they are good stimulants as
they do not affect the brain. The aromatic spirits of
ammonia is also a carminative. Externally they are
rubefacients, and when confined are vesicants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Its antacid and stimulant properties recommend
ammonia in indigestion, tympanites, and spasmodic
colic, especially in cattle and sheep. Stimulating
the spinals and respiratory systems, it is valuable in
the treatment of influenza, pneumonia, pleurisy and
similar complaints. The fumes of ammonia are occasionally
used to arouse animals from shocks, collapse, or
chloroform intoxication, but must be used cautiously,
lest excessive irritation of the respiratory mucous membrane
be produced. It is a promptly acting antidote in
poisoning by opium, aconite, digitalis, and ether narcotic
and sedative drugs. It may be administered much diluted
in the usual way, injected subcutaneously and
intravenously, and also applied externally, in the treatment
of snake-bites. On account of its producing
bronchial secretion, and assisting in its expulsion, ammonia
is serviceable as a stimulating expectorant. To
develop its more general effects its alcoholic proportions
should be prescribed as spirit of ammonia or the aromatic
spirit of ammonia. Externally used in the form of liniment
of ammonia, with oils, camphor, etc., proves useful
as a stimulant in rheumatism, stiff-joints, muscular<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
strains, sore throat, pleurisy, pneumonia and influenza,
and for preventing the rapid chilling of fomented surfaces.
It relieves the irritation caused by nettles, and
by bites and stings of insects.</p>

<h3>LINIMENTUM AMMONIAE&mdash;AMMONIA
LINIMENT</h3>

<p>Is made by mixing ammonia water, 350; cottonseed
oil, 570; alcohol, 50; oleic acid, 30. The above is recognized
by the U. S. P. and is advantageously used on
muscular strains and where an external stimulant is indicated.</p>

<h3>LIQUOR AMMONII ACETATIS&mdash;SOLUTION
OF AMMONIUM ACETATE</h3>

<p>An aqueous solution of ammonium acetate containing
about seven per cent of the salt, together with small
amounts of acetic acid and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Ammonium carbonate is gradually
added to cold, dilute acetic acid until the latter is materialized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clear, colorless liquid, mildly saline
and acidulous taste, and an acid reaction.</p>

<p>Incompatible with acids and alkalies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; dogs, 2 to 6 drs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Diaphoretic, antipyretic, mild stimulant,
mild diuretic, mild expectorant and stomachic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Its uses are recommended in febrile and inflammatory
attacks, especially in influenza, distemper,
etc., combined with other medicines, improves the appetite;
can be used externally as a refrigerant over
swollen and inflamed tendons.</p>

<h3>AMMONII CARBONAS&mdash;AMMONIUM
CARBONATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A mixture of ammonium chloride or
sulphate, and calcium carbonate, is sublimed and resublimed.
Ammonium carbonate, so-called, is a mixture of
ammonium carbonate and bicarbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White translucent masses, having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
strongly ammoniacal odor, and a sharp saline taste. On
exposure to air it loses both ammonia and carbonic
dioxide, soluble one part in four parts of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 3 drs.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 2 to 8 grs. Larger doses are
recommended when a antispasmodic or carminative is
desired the dose for horses and cattle can be increased
to an ounce, but only two doses should be administered,
well diluted in water or in ball or capsule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Ammonium carbonate is decomposed by
acid in the stomach and escapes in the urine. It stimulates
gastric secretion, vascularity and motion, and exciting
intestinal peristalsis. It is, therefore, a stomachic
and carminative. It is also an antacid, and, in large
doses, an emetic for dogs. It is given in capsules or in
solution in cold water, to avoid irritating fumes; also
with syrup or gruel. It is often prescribed with other
stimulants and antispasmodics, as alcohol, camphor,
capsicum and asafoetida. The action of ammonium carbonate
is almost identical with that of ammonia water in
stimulating the heart and respiration, but it has more
power in augmenting the bronchial secretions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is given to all animals in indigestion; conjoins
the actions of an antacid and diffusible stimulant;
in small doses promotes secretion of gastric juice, and
in larger, relieves flatulence and spasm. In diseases of
the air passages it is used as an expectorant; is contra-indicated
in purpura haemorrhagica, as it lowers the
oxygen carrying power of red blood corpuscles, and
dissolves fibrin. As a stimulant it can be combined with
alcohol and sulphuric ether. Ammonia is recommended
where a clot, thrombi or embolism is supposed to exist
on account of its defibrinating power. Ammonium carbonate
is used extensively in the treatment of spasmodic
and flatulent, colic and acute indigestion conjoined
with either asafoetida, capsicum, camphor, nux
vomica and alcohol.</p>

<h3>AMMONII CHLORIDIUM&mdash;MURIATE OF AMMONIA&mdash;SAL
AMMONIAC</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;This salt may be formed by neutralizing
crude solution of ammonia or ammonium carbonate
with hydrochloric acid and purifying the product.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, crystalline powder without
odor, having a cooling, saline taste, and permanent in
the air. Soluble in two parts of water; in fifty parts
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 2 drs.; cattle, 4 drs. to 1 oz.;
sheep and pigs, 15 grs. to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 10 grs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Internally it is an expectorant, alterative,
feebly diaphoretic and diuretic. When ingested,
ammonium chloride is a feeble heart and respiratory
stimulant, and is not comparable to the ammonia compounds
or ammonium carbonate in this respect. It is
eliminated in great part unchanged by the urine, but
also by the other channels. In its excretion it stimulates
the mucous membranes, increases their secretion generally,
and is thought to improve their nutrition. Ammonium
chloride both excites the secretion of the
bronchial mucous membrane and renders it less viscid in
inflammatory conditions. Externally it is a refrigerant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Useful in all diseases where an expectorant
is indicated, catarrhal condition, pneumonia, coughs, influenza,
chronic congestion of the liver, etc. Used externally
one part ammonium chloride dissolved in ten
parts of water as a refrigerant lotion for inflammatory
swellings, bruises and sprains.</p>

<h2>ARGENTI NITRAS&mdash;SILVER NITRATE</h2>

potassium nitrate, 60 parts, in a crucible at as low a
temperature as possible. Mix and cast into suitable
moulds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, hard, solid, generally in the
form of pencils or canes of a finely granular fracture;
becoming gray or grayish-black on exposure to light in
the presence of organic matter; odorless, having a caustic,
metallic taste. Soluble in water and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Melt silver nitrate, 100 parts, with
hydrochloric acid, 4 parts at as low a temperature as
possible. Mix and pour into suitable moulds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Practically same as mitigated silver
nitrate. Use only externally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Silver nitrate combines with the albumen
of the tissues, and is a limited caustic; causes superficial
inflammation and stains the parts black; small doses increase
secretion and stimulate the heart. It promotes
nutrition, and is said to be a nerve tonic. Its continued
administration causes waste, gastro-intestinal catarrh,
fluidity of the blood, slate colored lines about the gums,
and similar discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane,
followed by nervous disorder, paralysis, convulsions
and death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;A solution of forty grains to one ounce of
spirit of nitrous ether is said to abort superficial inflammation,
if early applied; used for erysipelas, twenty
grains to one ounce of distilled water, applied around
margin to limit the area; also used in ulceration of the
throat; used with a spray or swab, in strength of from
ten grains to one-half to drachm to one ounce of distilled
water. For dysentery, internally and as an enema<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
it is very good; used in conjunctivitis one to five grains
to one to two ounces of distilled water, is the average
strength, and should only be applied to the conjunctiva
or lids, and should not be on the cornea, as it may form
an insoluble chloride of silver and cause permanent
opacities. Nitrate of silver is used in the form of lunar
caustic to stimulate indolent ulcers, and to burn off
warts.</p>

<p>To stimulate ulcers, touch in spots around the edge;
also used in chorea epilepsy and chronic spinal disease,
foot rot in sheep; a piece of the caustic is placed in
sinuses of fistulous withers, quittors, etc. It causes a
slough, followed by healthy granulation; used for sore
teats in cows.</p>

<h2>ARNICAE&mdash;ARNICA</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Arnica is obtained from the flower roots
of a plant that grows in mountainous countries of Central
Europe, Asia and America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Composition.</span>&mdash;An active principle called arnicin.
The root contains an essential oil, on which depends in
great part its physiological activity.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTUM ARNICAE RADICIS&mdash;EXTRACT
OF ARNICA ROOT (NON-OFFICIAL)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 15 grs. to 1 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 5 to 10 grs.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 3 grs.</p>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM ARNICAE RADICIS&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
ARNICA ROOT
(NON-OFFICIAL)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 3 drs.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 2 to 10 ms.</p>

<h4>TINCTURA ARNICAE&mdash;TINCTURE OF
ARNICA</h4>

<p>This is the best and most used preparation of Arnica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 drs.; sheep and
pigs, 15 ms. to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 ms. This dose can
be given every three hours to maintain the circulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
of the skin; as a diaphoretic, the dose can and may be
increased and combined with other diaphoretics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Incompatibles.</span>&mdash;Its action is antagonized by ammonia,
alcoholic stimulants, opium, camphor, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Synergists.</span>&mdash;Aconite, veratrum viride, digitalis and
arterial sedatives, generally increase the effects of arnica.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Arnica is irritant, stimulant, depressant;
antipyretic, diuretic, diaphoretic and is used as a vulnerary,
it dilates the circular blood vessels. It irritates the
gastro-intestinal tract. In alcoholic solutions (as tincture
of arnica) it inflames the skin when used full
strength.</p>

<p>In small doses it increases the action of the heart,
raises arterial tension and stimulates the action of the
skin and kidneys.</p>

<p>Large doses produce a transient excitement, followed
by depressed circulation, respiration and temperature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is a very efficient diaphoretic for horses
in one or two ounce doses diluted in one pint of water;
one-half ounce of fluid extract pilocarpus may be added
at the outset of inflammatory diseases of any kind, such
as lymphangitis, laminitis, pulmonary diseases, etc. Excellent
to stop a chill and prevent the following fever or
inflammatory action. It does this by dilating the blood
vessels of the skin, thus attracting the blood to the surface
and away from congested internal organs. It is indicated
in sthetic fever of any kind; azoturia, rheumatism,
especially inflammatory or articular; congestion
of the brain, kidneys, etc., externally much used, but of
little value on hairy animals.</p>

<h2>ARSENUM&mdash;ARSENIC</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;The world’s supply of arsenic and arsenic
compounds at the present time is obtained from Germany,
Spain, England, Canada and portions of the
United States, as Montana and Washington, where considerable
quantities of arsenic are being produced as a
by-product in the smelting of copper ores. Arsenic ore is
roasted and purified by sublimation, before it is used for
medical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></p>

<h3>
ARSENI TRIOXIDUM&mdash;ARSENIC TRIOXIDE<br />
ACIDUM ARSENOSUM&mdash;ARCENOUS ACID<br />
(White Arsenic)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Arsenical ores are roasted or conducted
into condensing chambers and purified by sublimation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A heavy solid, occurring either as an
opaque, white powder, or in irregular masses of two
varieties; the one amorphous, transparent and colorless,
like glass; the other crystalline, opaque, and white, resembling
porcelain. Frequently the same piece has an
opaque, white outer crust enclosing the glassy variety.
Contact with moist air gradually changes the glassy into
the white opaque variety. Both are odorless and tasteless.
The glassy variety dissolves slowly in thirty parts of
water; the porcelain-like in eighty parts of water. Arcenous
acid is sparingly soluble in alcohol, but soluble
in glycerin, hydrochloric acid and solutions of the alkali
hydrates and carbonates. When heated to 424°, arcenous
acid is completely volatilized without melting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Incompatibles.</span>&mdash;Lime water, salts of iron and magnesia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 5 grs.; cattle, 2 to 8 grs.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 2 grs.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> gr.</p>

<h3>LIQUOR POTASSII ARSENITIS&mdash;SOLUTION
OF POTASSIUM ARSENITE (Fowler’s Solution)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Arcenous acid, potassium bicarbonate,
compound tincture of lavender and distilled
water. Strength one part of arcenous acid in 100.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 drs. to 1 oz.; cattle,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ozs.;
sheep and pigs, 10 to 40 ms.; dogs, 2 to 5 ms. Average
dose for horse is <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz. usually given three times daily
in drinking water or bran mash.</p>

<h3>LIQUOR ACIDI ARSENOSI&mdash;SOLUTION OF
ARCENOUS ACID</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Arcenous acid, diluted hydrochloric<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
acid, and distilled water. Strength one part arcenous
acid in 100.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as liquor potassii arsenitis.</p>

<h3>LIQUOR ARSENI ET HYDRARGYRI IODIDI
(Donovan’s Solution)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Arcenous iodide, red mercuric iodide,
and distilled water, which should contain not less then
one per cent of arcenous iodide and one per cent of
mercuric iodide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as liquor potassii arsenitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Arsenic and its compounds are gastro-intestinal
and pulmonary tonic, a stimulant and alterative,
acting particularly on the digestive and respiratory
mucous membranes and skin. It is antiperiodic and
tonic; also antispasmodic in diseases of the nervous system,
and is a nervine tonic. In large doses it is a corrosive-irritant
poison, killing either by gastro-enteritis,
or nervous paresis. Continued doses produce fatty degeneration.
On account of its being a stomachic, small
doses promote the appetite and digestion. Large doses
inflame the stomach and derange digestion. It increases
the cardiac action, respiratory power, and secretion of
the intestines. It also stimulates peristalsis. When
tolerance is established, large doses are taken with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Externally.</span>&mdash;Arsenic is a very painful escharotic,
exciting violent inflammation. It is a caustic, antiseptic,
and parasiticide, and is frequently used as a sheep dip.
It is eliminated chiefly by the kidneys, skin and saliva
and milk of nursing animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It should not be given in acute diseases. It
is given as a general tonic after debilitating diseases especially
when the lungs are involved, as in pneumonia,
bronchitis and pleurisy. Arsenic combined with bran
mashes is beneficial in stocking or swelling of the legs.
As for its use in chronic indigestion, other medicines
had better be resorted to. It assists in the expulsion of
worms. Useful in chronic diseases of the air passage.
Arsenic relieves irritable chronic coughs, and roaring in<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
early stages, as well as thick and broken wind and
heaves. As an alterative modifying tissue change it is
prescribed in early stages of tuberculosis, chronic rheumatism,
chorea and epilepsy. It prevents periodically
returning fevers. In anaemia it increases both red and
white blood corpuscles. For chorea in dogs, commence
with a small dose, three times daily and increase a minimum
per dose every third or fourth day until the physiological
limit is reached as described under (<a href="#Ref02">Toxicology
of Arsenic</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions on the Skin.</span>&mdash;Administered internally it
stimulates the dermis and hastens the removal of epidermal
cells; hence it is useful in all chronic skin diseases,
as chronic eczema, scab, mange and warts. To remove
warts that occur in the mouth and on the muzzle of
animals, give internally and apply locally Fowler’s
solution. In chronic skin diseases use Donovan’s or
Fowler’s solution or acidum arsenosum and sulphur
mixed in the feed. Useful internally in successive eruptions
of the skin boils and in chronic urticaria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">External Uses.</span>&mdash;The white arsenic or arcenous
acid is used to slough out tumors, fistulae, quittors, etc.
But I would not recommend it as it is too painful. It is
valuable in the treatment of foot-rot. The affected animals
should be slowly driven through a trough containing
a solution of arsenic. It is used extensively
for sheep and cattle to destroy ticks. In this way, animals
are sometimes poisoned, as it drips on the grass and
other animals eat it.</p>

<p id="Ref02"><span class="smcap">Toxicology of Arsenic.</span>&mdash;Full medical doses if
long continued, cause edema and itching of the eyelids,
increased flow of saliva nausea, diarrhoea or dysentery,
weak heart, soreness to the touch over the region of the
stomach, itchy skin with small eruptions, jaundice and
albuminuria. In long continued doses it diminishes
exudation, decomposes albuminoid tissues and produces
fatty degeneration; also lessens the glycogenic functions
of the liver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chronic Arsenical Poisoning.</span>&mdash;Is common in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
vicinity of either tin or copper smelting plants. The
symptoms are as follows: indigestion, thirst, wasting,
chronic diseases of joints and bones, the knee joints
swell, the animal becomes lame and hide-bound, hair
falls off, skin gets rough and scurfy, teeth get black and
fall out and necrosis of the bones follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antagonists and Incompatibles.</span>&mdash;The salts of
iron, magnesia, lime, and astringents, are chemically
incompatible. The hydroxide of iron, or as it is also
known, hydrate sesquioxide of iron, freshly made and
in soft magma is the antidote to arsenic. To dogs give
from half to one tablespoonful every five or ten minutes.
From eight to twenty grains of the antidote are required
to each grain of arsenic swallowed (when it can be determined).
The stomach should first be emptied by the
use of cathartics or stomach pump and then give the
antidote, and follow with demulcents as oil, milk and
mucilaginous drinks. Also administer diluents, as weak
alkaline water. Iodide of potassium is valuable as a
antidote of arsenical poisoning and should be administered
to promote elimination of the poison. In the
absence of the antidote, chalk, magnesia and lime water
may be freely given. These agents act mechanically by
developing the poison and preventing absorption.
Dialysed iron is recommended as efficacious as an
antidote in doses of five to fifteen minimums for dogs.</p>

<h2>ASPIDIUM&mdash;MALE FERN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The rhizome of Aspidium Filix-mas.
Collected late in the autumn, divested of its roots, leaves
and dead portions, and carefully dried. Male fern should
not be kept more than a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;The male fern grows wild throughout
most temperate regions, on the sides of roads and in open
woods, especially where the soil is light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Its root stock is perennial, about a
foot long and two inches thick; is scaly, tufted, greenish-brown,
and firmly fixed in the ground by numerous
black root fibers. The dried root has a disagreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
odor, and a sweet, astringent, nauseous taste. Powdered
male fern should be freshly prepared and have a bright
green color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;The powdered male fern is given to horses
and cattle in doses of 4 to 6 ozs.; sheep and pigs, 1 to
4 ozs.; dogs and cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 ozs. The powder is bulky,
and less certain than the oleoresin of aspidium.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>OLEORESINA ASPIDII&mdash;OLEORESIN ASPIDIUM&mdash;OLEORESIN
MALE FERN</h4>

<p>Made by percolation with ether, distillation and
evaporation of the ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 3 to 6 drs.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 2 drs.; dogs and cats, 15 ms. to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Male fern is irritant, vermicide
laxative, large doses of the drug cause hemorrhagic
gastro-enteritis, tremors, weakness, stupor, coma, acute
nephritis and cystitis. Oleoresin of male fern is one of
the most effectual remedies for tapeworm, particularly
those inhabiting dogs.</p>

<h2>BELLADONNAE FOLIA&mdash;BELLADONNA
LEAVES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Belladonna is the leaves of a plant known
as deadly nightshade. It grows wild in some parts of
Great Britain, and is also cultivated to a great extent.
The dried leaves of atropa belladonna yield, when
assayed by the U. S. P. process, not less than 0.35 per
cent of mydriatic alkaloids. Usually of a dull brownish-green
color, the leaves much wrinkled and matted together,
frequently with the flowering tops intermixed;
odor distinctly narcotic, especially on moistening; taste
somewhat bitter and acrid. Contains not less than 0.5
per cent atropine. The powdered leaves are characterized
by few hairs and numerous small arrow-shaped
crystals of calcium oxalate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Of the powdered leaves, horses and cattle,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 dr.; dogs, 1 to 5 grs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span></p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTUM BELLADONNAE FOLIORUM&mdash;EXTRACT
OF BELLADONNA LEAVES</h4>

<p>Made by percolation with dilute alcohol and evaporation
to pilular consistence. Used in preparing the unguentum
belladonnae. Contains 1.4 per cent of mydriatic
alkaloids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 10 to 20 grs.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 grs.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.</p>

<h2>BELLADONNAE RADIX&mdash;BELLADONNA
ROOT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The dried root of atropa belladonna
yielding, when assayed by the U. S. P. process not less
than 0.5 per cent of mydriatic alkaloids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Same as leaves. Contains not less
than 0.5 per cent atropine.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM BELLADONNAE RADICIS&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF BELLADONNA
ROOT</h4>

<p>Made by maceration with alcohol and water and
evaporation. One cc. of the extract = one gm. of belladonna
root. Standardized so that 100 cc. of the fluidextract
contain 0.5 gm. of mydriatic alkaloids. This
is one of the most reliable preparations of belladonna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 2 dr.; cattle, 2 to 3 dr.; sheep
and pigs, 10 to 15 ms.; dogs, 1 to 3 ms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span></p>

<h4>LINIMENTUM BELLADONNAE&mdash;BELLADONNA
LINIMENT</h4>

<p>Made by adding camphor, 50 parts to fluidextract
of belladonna to make 1,000 parts (U. S. P.).</p>

<h4>ATROPINAE SULPHAS&mdash;SULPHATE OF
ATROPHINE</h4>

<p>An alkaloid obtained from belladonna. As it occurs
in commerce, it is always accompanied by small proportion
of hyoscyamine extracted along with it, from
which it cannot readily be separated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Atropine is obtained from a strong
tincture of the root.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white crystalline powder, very
soluble in water and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grs.; cattle, 1 to 2 grs.;
sheep and pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub>
gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>150</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub>
gr. The doses should be considerably reduced when
used with morphine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Incompatibles.</span>&mdash;Caustic alkalies; antagonize physiologically
by pilocarpine and physostigma throughout
almost whole range of its influence, and opium within a
certain limitation, prevents the respiratory failure, which
is the cause of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span>&mdash;Belladonna is an irritant narcotic, a
mydriatic, an antispasmodic and anodyne. In small
doses a cardiac, respiratory and spinal stimulant; in large
doses a paralyzer of the sensory and motor nerve endings
and a stimulator of the entire sympathetic system.</p>

<p>It produces dryness of the mucous membrane of
the throat, mouth, nose and pharynx, and at first lessens
the gastric and intestinal secretions, but soon produces
them in large quantities. It is anti-galactogogue, that
is, it arrests secretion of milk.</p>

<p>The heart rate is at first slowed, but soon becomes
very rapid and vigorous, the pulse being doubled in
rapidity; arterial tension is raised and the circulation
greatly increased.</p>

<p>The pupils are dilated by the local or systemic use
of the drug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<p>The brain is congested by belladonna, a busy delirium
being produced, and hallucinations with mental disorder,
due to a selective action on the cell of the gray matter.</p>

<p>The spinal cord is stimulated from the second cervical
vertebrae to the tenth dorsal, resulting in paralysis of
the motor nerves, both central and peripheral, power
being lost in hind extremities first. The respiration is
increased and the temperature is raised by the increased
circulation; metamorphosis is greatly promoted.</p>

<p>Belladonna and atrophine are rapidly diffused and
quickly eliminated by the kidneys. By its paralyzing
effect on the terminal nerve filaments, it relaxes the
bronchial tubes and checks the secretion of the bronchial
mucous membrane; it checks secretion of saliva and
milk in the same way and causes dryness of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Belladonna and atrophine is indicated anywhere
that an antispasmodic and anodyne is needed.
Is serviceable in catarrh, pharyngitis and bronchitis to
check secretion in second stage; heaves, especially asthmatic
heaves, combined with gelsemium and lobelia, followed
by Fowler’s Solution; in influenza, it stimulates
the weakened heart, besides having other good effects.</p>

<p>In the first stage of respiratory diseases, belladonna
alone, or combined with aconite or other febrifuges and
expectorants; in cough, especially spasmodic or when
due to irritation of the throat; in heart failure or heart
weakness, hypodermic injections of atrophine are beneficial;
in spasmodic colic one to two drachms of the fluid
extract to a dose, but one drachm is usually sufficient;
as a powerful antispasmodic and anodyne, atropine and
morphine combined; small doses are given in constipation
of the bowels, combined with nux vomica; small
doses with purgatives are said to aid their action.</p>

<p>In tetanus give one to two drachms of the extract
two or three times daily; in paralysis of the throat of
tetanus the fluid extract combined with soap liniment
or used alone externally; in cerebro-spinal meningitis,
belladonna and ergot alternated with aconite is rational
treatment, conjoined with the external treatment. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
allays irritations of the bladder, rectum, and uterus, especially
if combined with cannabis indica.</p>

<p>In contraction or rigid os the extract applied directly,
quickly relaxes and allows parturition; it is well to see
if this is necessary before giving ergot.</p>

<p>Used extensively in examinations and diseases of the
eye.</p>

<p>Atrophine sulphate is used locally to dilate the pupil,
assisting in the detection of cataracts or other disorders
of the eye and testing the condition of the refracting
media; for dilating pupil use a solution of four grains
of the atrophine to one ounce of distilled water; a few
drops are placed into the eye, for inflammation of the
eye with great irritation; belladonna may be combined
with cocaine; in iritis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antidote.</span>&mdash;In poisoning, tannic acid should be used.</p>

<h2>BENZOINUM&mdash;BENZOIN</h2>

<p>A balsamic resin obtained from styrax benzoin
dryander, and another unidentified species of styrax.
It contains benzoic acid in the proportions 12 to 20 per
cent to which it probably owes its action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Southern Asia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;In pebble-like bodies or tears, slightly
flattened, straight or curved, yellowish to rusty-brown
externally, milky-white on fresh fractures internally.
Odor agreeable, balsamic; taste slightly acrid. It is
almost wholly soluble in five parts of moderately warm
alcohol, and in solutions of the fixed alkalies. When
heated it gives off fumes of benzoic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Benzoic acid, cinnamic acid; resins
and a volatile oil.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

of pure lithium benzoate, and should be kept in a well
stopped bottle. Soluble in 3 parts of water, and in 13
parts of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as benzoic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Benzoin is a mild stimulant, expectorant
and antiseptic; benzoic acid is quite powerful; it renders
alkaline urine acid; it is used to dissolve phosphatic
calculi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;The tincture and compound tincture are used
as stimulants and antiseptics for wounds and sores.
Benzoic acid, when administered internally, acts mildly
as an antiseptic to the bladder; useful in catarrh of the
bladder. Benzoate of soda is used in bronchial catarrh.
Benzoate of ammonia is used to dissolve phosphatic
calculi. Lithium benzoate has been highly recommended
as a remedy for rheumatic affections.</p>

<h2>CALAMUS&mdash;SWEET FLAG</h2>

<p>The unpeeled, dried rhizome of acorus calamus
Linne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;United States, Europe, Western and
Southern Asia, including India and Japan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;The leaves as well as the root have
an aromatic odor; but the root only is employed. It
should be collected late in the autumn, or in the early
spring. After removal from the ground, the roots are
washed, freed from their fibers, and dried with moderate
heat. By drying they lose nearly one-half their diameter,
but are improved in odor and taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Acorin, a liquid, yellow glucoside,
having a bitter taste; a volatile oil; calamine; choline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 3 drs.; dogs, 15 grs to 1 dr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM CALAMI&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF CALAMUS</h4>

<p>Made by maceration, percolation and evaporation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 3 drs.; dogs, 15 ms. to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Calanus is a feeble aromatic
bitter, and is therefore useful in loss of appetite and indigestion
associated with mild forms of flatulence. The
powdered root is used as a base in powders, balls and
electuaries. It is harmless, and the dose is therefore
unimportant.</p>

<h2>CALX LIME&mdash;CALCIUM OXIDE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Prepared by burning white marble,
oyster shells, or the purest varieties of natural calcium
carbonate; to expel carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Lime is in hard, white or grayish-white
masses, which in contact with air gradually attract
moisture and carbon dioxide and fall to a white powder;
odorless; of a sharp caustic taste. Soluble in water;
insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Antacid, gastric sedative, intestinal astringent,
desiccant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Its principal use is in diarrhoea, combined
with opium tannic acid, also antiseptics; makes a very
good dusting powder over abraded surfaces. Lime
water and milk equal parts and sweetened is very good
for puppies raised on a bottle as it is easily digested.</p>

<h3>LINIMENTUM CALCIS&mdash;LIME LINIMENT
(Carron Oil)</h3>

<p>Composed of lime water and raw linseed oil equal
parts; is very good for burns. Carron oil given internally
is a good, mild laxative and antacid for horses
with heaves. It is given on the food. It is also an excellent
purgative for foals and calves in the treatment
of diarrhoea and indigestion.</p>

<h2>CALUMBA</h2>

<p>The dried transversely cut slices of the root of
Jateorhiza Calumba.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Mozambique, East Africa. Cultivated
in the East Indies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Odor slight, taste bitter. It contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
calumbin, a neutral bitter, crystalline substance; an alkaloid,
berberine; calumbic acid and starch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 2 drs.; dogs, 5 to 30 grs.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM CALUMBAE&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF CALUMBA</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with alcohol
and water, and evaporation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as calumba.</p>

<h4>TINCTURA CALUMBAE&mdash;TINCTURE OF
CALUMBA</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation of calumbae,
with alcohol and water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 ozs.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; dogs, 1 to 2 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions and Uses.</span>&mdash;Calumba is a bitter, gastric
stimulant and carminative. It promotes secretion of
gastric juice and improves the appetite. As it contains
no tannin it is devoid of astringency and may be prescribed
with preparations of iron. Like qussia, calumba
infusion may be used to destroy worms in the horse’s
rectum.</p>

<h2>GAMBOGIA&mdash;GAMBOGE</h2>

<p>A gum-resin obtained from garcinia hunburii
Hooker filius (nat. ord. guttiferae).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Southern Asia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;In cylindrical pieces, usually hollow
in the center, externally grayish orange-brown, longitudinally
striate; fracture conchordal, orange-red, waxy and
somewhat porous; inodorous; taste very acid. Powder
bright yellow, sternutatory, containing few or no starch
grains. Not more than 25 per cent should be soluble
in alcohol; ash not more than 3 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz.;
sheep and pigs, 20 grs. to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 10 grs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Gamboge is a drastic, hydragogue purgative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
and slightly diuretic. Its action is uncertain and
often violent, with production of griping pains. Large
doses cause vomiting in the dog and gastro-enteritis in
all that cannot vomit. Gamboge is dissolved by the bile
and alkaline intestinal juices and some of it is absorbed,
since it colors the urine yellow in its elimination and
occasions diuresis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Gamboge should never be prescribed alone.
It has been recommended in obstinate constipation, indigestion,
impaction of the third stomach, and brain diseases
of cattle, conjoined with salts, or rubbed up with
water and an equal amount of aloes (each one ounce).</p>

<h2>CAMPHORA&mdash;CAMPHOR&mdash;GUM CAMPHOR</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Camphor is obtained from a tree
known as Laurel Camphor. The branches are cut and
boiled in water and the camphor rises to the top in the
form of gum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Japan, China and Sunda Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White translucent masses, of a tough
consistence and a crystalline structure, readily pulverizable
in the presence of a little alcohol ether or chloroform;
having a penetrating characteristic odor, and a
pungent aromatic taste. Very sparingly soluble in
water, but readily soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform,
carbon disulphide, petroleum, benzine and in fixed and
volatile oils. On exposure to the air, it evaporates more
or less rapidly at ordinary temperatures, and when moderately
heated, it sublimes without leaving a residue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 3 drs.; cattle, 2 to 4 drs.; sheep
and pigs, 15 grs. to 1 dr.; dogs, 3 to 30 grs.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>AQUA CAMPHORAE&mdash;CAMPHOR WATER</h4>

<p>Tincture camphor 8, with alcohol 8 and purified talc
15; then with water to make 1000 filter.</p>

<p>Camphor water has this advantage over camphor in
substance, that the latter is with difficulty dissolved by
liquids of the stomach; but it is too feeble a preparation
for use when a decided effect is desired; it is, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
an excellent vehicle for the administration of more active
substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Ad lib.</p>

<h4>SPIRITUS CAMPHORAE&mdash;SPIRIT OF
CAMPHOR</h4>

<p>Made by dissolving gum camphor, 100, in alcohol,
800; filter and add alcohol to make 1000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 30 grs. to 1 dr. Spirit of camphor
is frequently prescribed in colic mixtures.</p>

<h4>LINIMENTUM CAMPHORAE&mdash;CAMPHOR
LINIMENT&mdash;CAMPHORATED OIL</h4>

<p>Made by adding camphor, 200 parts to cottonseed
oil, 800 parts.</p>

<p>It is a mild rubefacient; is used in cough mixtures,
also used locally in liniments.</p>

<h4>CERATUM CAMPHORAE&mdash;CAMPHOR
CERATE</h4>

<p>Composed of camphor liniment, 100 parts, white
wax 350 parts, white petrolatum 150 parts, lard 400
parts.</p>

<p>For external use only.</p>

<h4>LINIMENTUM SAPONIS&mdash;SOAP LINIMENT</h4>

<p>Composed of soap 60 parts, camphor 45 parts, oil
of rosemary 10 parts, alcohol 725 parts, water to make
1000 parts; for external use only, as a mild stimulating
and anodyne liniment, usually combined with other
medicines and used for its stimulating properties.</p>

<h4>CAMPHORA MONOBROMATA&mdash;MONOBROMATED
CAMPHOR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by heating camphor and bromine
in the proper chemical proportions for three
hours in a sealed tube, in a water bath. The crystalline
masses washed with water, recrystallized from
alcohol after treatment with animal charcoal, washed<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide, then
with much water and finally recrystallized from a mixture
of alcohol and ether. It is very easy to prepare
the monobromide on a small scale in this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, prismatic needles or scales,
permanent in air, almost soluble in water, freely soluble
in alcohol, ether, chloroform and fixed and volatile
oils; used frequently as an anaphrodisiac.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Dogs, 2 to 10 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Antispasmodic or nerve stimulant, anodyne,
antiseptic, diaphoretic, a stimulant, expectorant, a
cerebral excitant or narcotic, a gastro-intestinal irritant,
a rubefacient or counter-irritant and also carminative.
It has an acrid hot taste, irritates the skin and mucous
membrane, large doses causing gastro-intestinal inflammation.</p>

<p>Medical doses stimulate the vaso-motor system and
the cardiac-motor ganglia, and lessens the influence of
the pneumogastric (inhibitory nerve); afterwards stimulates
the accelerator apparatus, thus increasing the
circulation and raising arterial tension; it also stimulates
respiration, and in man stimulates mental activity
even to intoxication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;In catarrhal conditions, cough mixtures,
acute and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia. The spirits
of camphor is used in colic mixtures; also locally to stop
secretions of milk applied frequently; in cardiac weakness;
strangury may be relieved by one to two ounce
doses of the spirits for the horse. Spirits of camphor is
used in Thumps.</p>

<p>Camphor is a valuable medicine in diarrhoea, particularly
in serious variety, and in that form following exposure
to cold. It is not useful in inflammatory conditions,
but checks secretions and pain.</p>

<p>Spirit of camphor and nitrous ether are efficient in
relieving irritation of the genito-urinary tract. Camphor
has proven of service in purpura hemorrhagica of
horses given three times daily in capsules or pills.</p>

<h2>CANTHARIS&mdash;CANTHARIDES&mdash;SPANISH
FLY&mdash;BLISTER BEETLES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Cantharides is obtained from flies
which receive the name Spanish Fly on account of so
many of them coming from Spain, but they are also
imported from Germany and Russia; living chiefly on
climbing shrubs and trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;About 20 to 25 m. m. long and about
6 mm. broad, flattish cylindrical, with filiform antennae,
black in the upper part, and with long wing-sheaths, and
ample membranous, transparent, brownish wings, elsewhere
of a shining, coppery-green color. The powder
is grayish-brown, and contains green shining particles.
Odor strong and disagreeable; taste slight, afterwards
irritating. Cantharides deteriorate with age and should
be kept unpowdered in tightly stoppered bottles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Of the powdered fly, horses and cattle, 5 to
10 gr.; sheep and pigs, 3 to 6 gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 gr.</p>

<h3>TINCTURA CANTHARIDIS&mdash;TINCTURE OF
CANTHARIDES</h3>

<p>Prepared by percolation of powdered cantharides,
100 parts, with alcohol to make 1000 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 15 to 30 m.; dogs, 2 to 15 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Externally, is rubefacient, irritant, vesicant,
according to the strength used, it promotes water
blister; counter-irritant, etc. Cantharides acts more
powerfully on the skin of horses and dogs than on that
of cattle and swine. If applied over an extensive surface,
absorption and poisoning may occur.</p>

<p>Internally cantharides is an irritant, and produces
its effects on any part which the free cantharidin is
brought into contact. When swallowed it irritates the
digestive mucous membrane; large doses produce gastro-enteritis.
The active cantharidin is absorbed, and in
the blood forms a non-irritant albuminoid, but in the
kidneys is again liberated, developing its characteristic
irritation, medical doses stimulating the urino-genital
tract, causing diuresis, and in some animals increases<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
sexual appetite; full doses induce inflammation, slow
and painful discharge of bloody urine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Externally cantharides is employed as a
blister rubefacient or as a counter-irritant; blisters are
formed in from two to eight hours. If repeatedly used
it may cause sloughing of the tissue; cantharides may
be used wherever a blister or counter-irritant is required,
except in inflammation of the urinary organs, as it is
absorbed and will increase the inflammation. Cantharides
conjoined with red mercurous iodide and adeps
is usually employed in the treatment of diseases of the
bones, joints, bursae, ligaments and tendons. In exostoses,
as bone spavin and ring bone, used most effectively
after the actual cautery, to secure absorption
and resolution, or anchylosis. Always clip off the hair
close before applying a blister, tie or muzzle the animal
so he cannot bite it; leave blister on forty-eight hours,
then wash and grease the parts daily. A cantharides
blister is sometimes beneficial in hastening the formation
of abscess (distemper); also to stimulate indolent
ulcers or wounds; it causes swelling and closes the opening
of small umbilical hernias of foals and calves. It
is also valuable in closing and sealing punctured wounds
into joints and synovial cavities. The tincture of cantharides
can be applied once or twice daily, full strength,
when the exudation of much serum is desired. Cantharides
is seldom used internally except in incontinuence
of urine from debility or partial paralysis of the
bladder. Seldom used to increase sexual desire. The
tincture of cantharides should be employed when the
drug is administered internally.</p>

<h2>CAPSICUM&mdash;RED PEPPER&mdash;CAYENNE
PEPPER</h2>

<p>The dried ripe fruit of Capsicum fastigiatum Blume
deprived of its calyx.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Tropical America; cultivated also in
other tropical countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Capsicum when ground has a hot,
pungent, spicy taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Capsicum contains capsaicin, a
crystallizable, acrid body; capsicin, a volatile alkaloid;
a fixed oil; fatty matter; resin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 20 gr. to 1 dr.; cattle, 1 to 2 dr.,
sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 gr.; dogs, 1 to 5 gr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM CAPSICI&mdash;FLUID EXTRACT
OF CAPSICUM</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with alcohol,
and evaporated, so that 1 cc. equals 1 gm. of the crude
drug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 10 m. to 1 dr.; cattle, 1 to 2 dr.;
sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs, 1 to 5 m.</p>

<h4>TINCTURA CAPSICI&mdash;TINCTURE OF
CAPSICUM</h4>

<p>Made by percolation of capsicum, 100, with alcohol
and water to make 1,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 to 4 dr.; cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 20 m. to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 m.</p>

<h4>OLEORESINA CAPSICI&mdash;OLEORESIN OF
CAPSICUM</h4>

<p>Made by percolation with acetone, distillation and
evaporation of the residue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 10 to 30 m.; cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 5 m.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Capsicum and its preparations
are irritants, stimulating stomachics, carminatives and
rubefacients. Large doses, especially in carnivora and
omnivora, are irritant poisons, inflaming the alimentary
and sometimes also the urino-genital mucous membranes.
Properly regulated doses are indicated in
atonic indigestion and flatulent colic in horses combined
with ammonium carbonate. It may be advantageously
combined with bitters, as nux vomica. Capsicum is a
favorite stimulant and tonic remedy&mdash;to the digestion&mdash;with
poultry fanciers. It also increases the laying of
eggs when given to hens. Externally capsicum is rubefacient<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
and counter-irritant, producing about the same
degree of irritation as mustard, but causing considerable
pain. It ought not be used for blistering ointments or
for setons.</p>

<h2>CHLOROFORMUM&mdash;CHLOROFORM</h2>

<p>A liquid consisting of 99 to 99.4 per cent, by weight,
of absolute chloroform, and 0.6 to 1 per cent alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Alcohol and water are heated in a still
to 37.70° C. (100° F.), when chlorinated lime is added
and chloroform is evolved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Chloroform is a heavy, clear, colorless,
mobile and diffusible liquid, of a characteristic ethereal
odor, and a burning sweet taste. Specific gravity not
below 1.476 at 25° C. (77° F.). Soluble in 200 times
its volume of cold water, and in all proportions in alcohol,
ether, benzol, benzine and the fixed and volatile oils.
Chloroform is not inflammable. Chloroform should be
kept in dark amber colored well stoppered bottles in a
cool and dark place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 dr.; sheep and pigs,
20 to 40 m.; dogs, 2 to 8 m. Should be well diluted with
glycerine, syrup, eggs or diluted alcohol; the above dose
can be repeated every two or three hours.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>AQUA CHLOROFORMI&mdash;CHLOROFORM
WATER</h4>

<p>A saturated solution of chloroform and distilled water,
it should contain one-half per cent of chloroform.
Chloroform water has been proven to be an excellent
vehicle for administering active remedies, and, owing to
its antiseptic properties, mixtures having it for a basis
resist decomposition longer than those made with ordinary
water. Used extensively as a vehicle in cough and
diarrhoea mixtures.</p>

<h4>LINIMENTUM CHLOROFORMI&mdash;CHLOROFORM
LINIMENT</h4>

<p>Made from chloroform, 300 parts, soap liniment 700
parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span></p>

<h4>SPIRITUS CHLOROFORMI</h4>

<p>Made from chloroform 60 parts, alcohol, 940 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 20 to 40 m.</p>

<h4>CHLOROFORM EMULSUM&mdash;EMULSION OF
CHLOROFORM</h4>

<p>Made from chloroform, expressed oil of almond,
tragacanth and water. Should contain four per cent of
chloroform. A good agent and vehicle for diarrhoea
and vermifuge mixtures for small animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Dogs, 2 dr. to 1 oz.; cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Chloroform is a topical irritant, antiseptic,
parasiticide, carminative, antispasmodic and analgesic.
Full doses quickly and powerfully paralyze the
cerebro-spinal nervous system; chloroform kills by paralyzing
the heart and respiration; the latter effects are
most rapidly produced when the drug is inhaled. Chloroform
is the general anaesthetic most used for veterinary
purposes except for dogs.</p>

<p>Externally it is rubefacient if confined or even suppurant.
It also acts as a refrigerant, anodyne and local
anaesthetic if not confined. It penetrates the skin very
readily and on this account is commonly used in liniments
to aid in the absorption of other medicines.</p>

<p>Chloroform compared to ether is much more irritating
to the mucous membrane, and causes violent
gastro-enteritis, if swallowed undiluted; it is less stimulating
and more depressing to the heart and circulation.
For inhalation it requires much more air; is less irritant
to the air passages than ether; is uninflammable,
more pleasant, more prompt in action, has a shorter
stage of excitement, causes a more profound narcosis,
and is not so nauseating as ether and is cheaper. Statistics
show it to be five times more fatal than ether.</p>

<p>The results of various experiments show that chloroform
and ether both act in the same manner upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
heart and respiration, paralyzing the latter first; but
chloroform acts much more quickly and powerfully than
ether in both directions. But when chloroform is inhaled
in a concentrated form it generally paralyzes the
heart first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Chloroform should be used as an aid in painful
and prolonged cases of parturition, especially where
you have tumultuous contraction of the uterus, or rigid
contraction of the os. Use just enough by inhalation
to dull the pain and relax the parts; it will aid you in
your efforts to rectify abnormal presentations by relaxing
the parts.</p>

<p>Internally it is used in spasmodic and flatulent colic
as it is an antispasmodic carminative and anodyne in its
effects; chloroform combined with belladonna and opium
is very beneficial in spasmodic coughs, given in linseed
gruel or water, well diluted; in liniments about one or
two ounces to the pint. Chloroform is used in chronic
diarrhoea with other medicines, such as morphine, capsicum,
camphor, oil of peppermint and ether. It is also
a good taeniacide.</p>

<h2>ANESTHESIA</h2>

<p>Anesthesia is divided into three stages; the stimulant,
anaesthetic and paralytic.</p>

<p><i>In the first stage</i> there is struggling and excitement,
due partly to the action of the drug and partly to fright.
The local irritant action of the vapor causes choking and
coughing, which also induces struggling.</p>

<p>The respiratory and cardiac centers are temporarily
stimulated, as a consequence of which the pulse and respiratory
movements are increased in force and frequency
and blood tension is raised.</p>

<p>The smaller animals, particularly the dog, may vomit
during the first stage of anaesthesia. In the first stage
the dog may bark, whine or howl, the horse neighs and
groans; other animals give expression to sounds more
or less characteristic to their species.</p>

<p><i>The second or anesthetic stage</i> is characterized by<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
loss of consciousness, sensation, motion and partial loss
of reflex action and is that state suitable for operations.
The stimulating action of the anesthetic has passed
and there is now depression of the cerebral functions,
the motor centers. The voluntary muscles are completely
relaxed, the sphincters occasionally, the patient
lies absolutely motionless, the cornea fails to respond
to irritation, i. e., winking is not produced when the
cornea is lightly touched with the finger. Sometimes
the muscles are rigid and twitching during this stage of
anesthesia, though sensation and consciousness are
absent. In the anesthesia stage the pulse is slow, full
and strong, due to lowered blood pressure, the breathing
is slow and shallow but regular.</p>

<p><i>The third or paralytic stage</i>, which must be carefully
watched against, poisoning is beginning and there is
depression of the three great medullary centers controlling
the heart, respiration and vascular tension and also
the posterior reflex centers of the spinal cord, so that
the urine and faeces are passed involuntarily. The passage
of urine frequently occurs in the first stages of
anesthesia and should not of itself be considered a
danger mark. When the pulse becomes rapid, feeble
and irregular, the breathing is at first stertorous and
then the respiratory movements become shallow and
weak, with long intervals intervening between them; this
irregularity is a most important danger sign. The skin
and mucous membrane often become cold and clammy.
The pupils are usually widely dilated, though death
may occur with either dilated or contracted pupils and
consequently no dependence should be put in this sign
unless there has been a sudden change from one condition
of the pupils to the other. The three above mentioned
stages are conventional, and are not in any case so
clearly defined in practice as they are described theoretically
upon paper. The first stage may be either absent
or prolonged, and the last stage should not be reached
at all.</p>

<p>Consequently you can see considering both drugs
to be properly administered, all the advantages are in
favor of chloroform except safety.</p>

<p>Ether is to be preferred for dogs, cats and other
small animals.</p>

<p>Chloroform is especially dangerous for dogs, though
horses stand it exceptionally well and it is preferable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
ether in large animals. The safety with which chloroform
may be administered to large animals frequently
makes veterinarians careless; that is, they “force” the
drug; they do not allow sufficient air for dilution, and
though the patients may not die from the immediate
effects of the drug their existence may be terminated in
a few days from pneumonia or broncho-pneumonia
(mechanical), due to the irritating effects of the drug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anaesthesia.</span>&mdash;It is best to cast the large animals;
after complete anaesthesia remove the hobbles.</p>

<p>For dogs make a cone of a towel and paper, put a
sponge in the bottom, allowing a small opening in the
end to admit air; pour in ether a little at a time.</p>

<p>In brain diseases or tumors of the brain, chloroform
is dangerous. Horses with heaves or emphysema should
not take chloroform; it is also dangerous in fatty degeneration
of the heart. Operations during incomplete
anaesthesia, especially with chloroform, are dangerous;
always produce complete anaesthesia, have the stomach
empty, but don’t fast animals for more than two or three
meals.</p>

<p><i>Things to remember when administering an anaesthetic:</i></p>

<p>The operator must be skilled and give his attention
exclusively to the production of anaesthesia, watching
the respiration and pulse for signs of failure.</p>

<p>Do not commence operation until anaesthesia is profound,
until reflex action is abolished, which can be told
by touching the eye with the finger; obey this, no matter
how slight the operation. The utmost care should be
exercised if the patient is very old or has fatty degeneration
of the heart, or lung diseases.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in operations about
the mouth or trachea. See that no blood passes down
the trachea. The stomach and bowels should be empty.
This will cause less nausea and feed may be regurgitated
and run down the trachea.</p>

<p>When purchasing chloroform or ether for anaesthetic
purposes insist on the best; it must be pure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Ether can be used almost pure, only a little air being
necessarily allowed for dilution; chloroform must have a
large amount of air.</p>

<p>In all classes of patients the head should be slightly
raised, and watch the tongue so that it does not fall back
over the larynx and suffocate the animal.</p>

<p>Anaesthesia should be started very slowly; don’t
force either chloroform or ether.</p>

<p>It is a good practice to have restoratives ready for
use before commencing anaesthesia, as aqua ammonia
fort., a hypodermic syringe and nitro-glycerin.</p>

<h2>CINCHONA</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Cinchona is obtained from the bark of a
tree (Cinchona Calisaya), which grows in South America,
East Indies and Jamaica. It contains at least
five per cent of its peculiar alkaloids, of which not less
than one-half should be quinine sulphate, which is the
most important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Cinchona is an astringent. Other than
that cinchona and its alkaloids possess the same actions,
that being, bitter tonic, stimulant, antiseptic, antiperiodic,
antipyretic, antiphlogistic, antimiasmatic, stomachic
and antiferment. Large doses are general depressants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Cinchona and its alkaloids are recommended
for all classes of patients as bitter stomachic and tonics.
They stimulate the appetite, check abnormal gastro-intestinal
fermentation and counteract relaxed conditions
of the intestines and the accumulations of mucus, which
prove favorable to the development of worms.</p>

<p>In troublesome cases of atonic indigestion in horses
respond rapidly when quinine sulphate is frequently
given in thirty to forty grain doses with half a drachm
of dilute nitric or hydrochloric acid. Weak foals and
calves suffering from relaxed condition of the bowels,
following a dose of castor oil are often much benefited
by a few doses of cinchona bark, hydrochloric acid dilute
and brandy.</p>

<p>Few medicines are so effectual as cinchona bark or<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
quinine sulphate in improving appetite and muscular
strength and hastening convalescence from debilitating
disease.</p>

<p>They are advantageous in anaemia joined with iron
salts.</p>

<p>Good results are obtained from cinchona or quinine in
the earlier stages of tuberculosis, in septicaemia and
pyaemia in all animals; in influenza, protracted cases of
strangles, purpura and other similar diseases of the
horse; in septic metritis in cows and ewes and in lingering
cases of distemper in dogs. Their beneficial effects
in these and other diseases probably depending on the
action of quinine on micro-organisms or their products.
It is often useful in rheumatism conjoined with salicylic
acid or potassium iodide. Administered with cathartics,
like other bitter tonics, it generally increases their activity.
Alternated with cod liver or olive oil and iron,
quinine is the best tonic for weak dogs and those suffering
from chorea.</p>

<p>Quinine and urea hydrochloride has recently come
into use as local anaesthetic. One per cent solutions
make a satisfactory substitute for cocaine, etc. It also
has advantages over cocaine. It is non-toxic, it may be
exposed to a boiling temperature and its anaesthetic
effect for dogs after an operation, therefore aiding in
dressing of wounds. Its anaesthetic effect comes on
within five minutes to half an hour after being injected
into the intended seat of operation.</p>

<p>Speaking from practical experience, I prefer quinine
and urea hydrochloride to cocaine or any of its allies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Of the powdered cinchona bark: Horses, 2
dr. to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 4 dr.;
dogs, 10 gr. to 1 dr.</p>

<h2>COCAINAE HYDROCHLORIDUM&mdash;COCAINE
HYDROCHLORIDE</h2>

<p>“The dried leaves of Erythroxylon Coca Lamarck
(Fam. Erythroxylaceae), known commercially as
Huanuco Coca, or of E. Truxillense Rusby, known commercially
as Truxillo Coca, yielding when assayed not
less than 0.5 per cent of the ether-soluble alkaloids of
coca.” U. S. “The dried leaves of Erythroxylum
Coca, Lam., and its varieties.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Cultivated in Peru and Bolivia and introduced
into medicine by Koller in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Cocaine hydrochloride is recovered
by agitating an acidulated alcoholic solution of coca
leaves with ether. The etheral liquid is made alkaline
with sodium carbonate and evaporated. The residue is
purified, deodorized, neutralized with hydrochloric acid
and finally crystallized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless, transparent, monoclinic
prism, flaky, lustrous leaflets or a white crystalline
powder; permanent in air, containing no water of
crystallization; odorless; of a saline, slightly bitter taste,
and producing on the tongue a tingling sensation followed
by numbness of several minutes’ duration. Soluble
in 0.4 part of water, 2.6 parts of alcohol and in 18.5
parts of chloroform at 25° C. (77° F.); soluble in benzine,
petroleum benzine and ether. It leaves no residue
on incineration. Its aqueous solution is neutral to litmus
paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 5 to 20 gr.; sheep and
pigs, 1 to 3 gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to 1 gr. Not much used internally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span>&mdash;Cocaine in small doses is a cerebral, cardiac,
respiratory and nervous stimulant and dieuretic;
overdoses cause delirium with cardiac and respiratory
failure. Cocaine is a powerful local anaesthetic; used
for all animals in 4 to 10 per cent solution, usually a
4 to 6 per cent solution is strong enough for ordinary
operations. Inject under the skin, into the muscular
tissue or over nerve trunks for minor operations. Applied
to such structures as the eye, penis, tongue and
other delicate mucous surfaces as the uterus, vagina,
rectum, etc. It causes profound but temporary anaesthesia
over a small area; it causes rapid and extreme
dilation of the pupil.</p>

<p>Cocaine is injected for minor operations to prevent
pain, such as neurectomy, removing tumors, operations
on the eyes, tongue, fistulae, firing, etc. For dogs it
should be used with great caution, a two per cent solution
usually being enough and as little as possible being
used.</p>

<p>For the horse, as a rule, not more than two drachms
of a five per cent solution should be injected subcutaneously,
lest restlessness, excitement, etc., ensue, which
though not necessarily dangerous, may interfere with
the operation.</p>

<p>In using cocaine as a diagnostic agent for lameness,
the fact must not be lost sight of that it is a cerebral
stimulant and that if a large quantity is injected it may
cause such a degree of excitement as to make the patient
forget his lameness, thus leading the operator to believe
that the improvement is due to anaesthesia below the
point of injection, when the apparent remission from the
lameness is of physical origin. Cocaine is advantageously
used in painful eye affections. Its effects may
be prolonged and the danger of its use lessened by dissolving
the cocaine in a 1 to 1000 adrenalin chloride
solution.</p>

<h2>CRETA PRAEPARATA&mdash;PREPARED CHALK</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Native calcium carbonate, freed from
most of its impurities by elutriation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, amorphous powder, often
molded into conical drops; odorless and tasteless; permanent
in the air. Almost insoluble in water; insoluble
in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 2 oz.; cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 10 gr. to 1 dr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>PULVIS CRETAE COMPOSITUS&mdash;COMPOUND
CHALK POWDER</h4>

<p>Composed of chalk, 30 parts; acacia, 20 parts; sugar,
50 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Dogs, 10 gr. to 1 dr.; cats, 1 to 5 gr.</p>

<h4>MISTURA CRETAE&mdash;CHALK MIXTURE</h4>

<p>Composed of compound chalk powder, 20 parts; cinnamon
water, 40 parts; water to make 100.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Dogs, 1 to 2 oz.; cats, 1 to 2 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Internally, chalk is the slowest acting
antacid, because of its comparative insolubility and is of
value when it can exert its long-continued influence
throughout the digestive tract. It resembles bismuth in
mechanically coating or protecting inflamed or irritable
surfaces. It is not so astringent nor antiseptic as the
bismuth salts, and these are generally preferable to chalk
for the smaller animals. It is excreted unchanged in
the feces. Externally it is a dessicant and slightly
astringent powder, also protective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Chalk forms a dusting powder for moist
eczema, slight burns and intertrigo; zinc oxide and starch
(one to four) is, however, a better preparation. Chalk
is the most useful antacid for diarrhoea accompanied by
fermentation of the intestinal contents, while its local
astringent and protecting influence assists in overcoming
the trouble. It is especially good for foals and calves
given in flour gruel and often conjoined with catechu,
ginger and opium.</p>

<p>Chalk may be given to dogs in pills or powder; to
other animals in powder, capsules or electuary. Chalk
is frequently prescribed suspended in flour, gruel, milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
or mucilage to the larger animals. The chalk preparations
are suitable for dogs and cats.</p>

<h2>CUPRI SULPHAS&mdash;COPPER SULPHATE&mdash;BLUE
VITRIOL&mdash;BLUE STONE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Boil metallic copper and sulphuric
acid together. Dissolve product in hot water and
crystallize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Large, transparent, deep blue, triclinic
crystals; odorless, of a nauseous, metallic taste;
slowly efflorescent in dry air; soluble in water; almost
insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 dr.; sheep and pigs,
20 to 40 gr.; dogs, 1 to 2 gr.</p>

<p>As a tonic and astringent, repeat two or three times
daily; given either in capsule or in some mucilagenous
solution, or in powder form, with some inert substance;
when given as a tonic should be given at time of feeding,
or right after eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Gastro-intestinal irritant, astringent,
tonic, emetic in large doses; acts directly on the stomach;
antiseptic and vermifuge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Internally used as emetic, antidote for phosphorus,
atony of the bowels, diarrhoea, especially combined
with dilute sulphuric acid opium; is supposed to
prevent the development of farcy and glanders in exposed
animals. Used externally as a caustic and stimulant;
styptic, also used for foot-rot; for granular eyelids,
touch lightly over the granular surface with the
sulphate of copper.</p>

<h2>DIGITALIS&mdash;FOXGLOVE</h2>

<p>The dried leaves of Digitalis purpurea Linne (Fam.
Scrophulariaceae), collected from plants of the second
year’s growth, at the commencement of flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Foxglove grows wild in the temperate
parts of Europe, where it flowers in the middle of summer.
In this country it is cultivated for ornamental
and for medical use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Foxglove is without odor in the recent<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
state, but acquires a faint narcotic odor when dried.
The color of the dried leaf is a dull pale green, modified
by the whitish down upon the under surface; that of
the powder is a fine deep green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Digitalein, Digitonin, Digitalin
and Digitoxin, the latter is most poisonous and active.
Said to be cumulative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Digitalis leaves, horses, 15 gr. to 1 dr.; cattle,
30 gr to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> dr.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 15 gr.; dogs,

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as digitoxin.</p>

<p>Digitalin, a very bitter, crystalline substance, soluble
in alcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as for digitoxin.</p>

<p>Digitonin, resembling or identical with saponin of
senega. White, amorphous powder, soluble in water.
It is a heart depressant, muscular paralyzant and powerful
irritant, besides being antagonistic to digitalis. In
addition to these principles there are: Digitin, an inactive
substance. Digitalic and antirrhinic acids. Tannin
coloring matter, starch, sugar, gum, a volatile oil,
salts, etc., common to most vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 m.</p>

<h4>INFUSUM DIGITALIS&mdash;INFUSION OF

water to make 1000 parts. By maceration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; dogs, 1 to 4 dr.</p>

<p>There are several substitutes for digitalis found in
commerce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;A cardiac and vascular tonic and stimulant,
a motor excitant, paralyzant, anaphrodisiac, it is
an indirect diuretic and an emetic, irritates the mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>The heart is slowed but the force is increased; digitalis
stimulates the cardiac motor ganglia, the inhibitory
apparatus and the vaso-motor centers, contracting the
arterioles and thereby greatly raising the arterial tension;
large doses exhaust and paralyze the heart.</p>

<p>Its diuretic action is very complex, one of the active
principles, digitalin, increases the arterial pressure by
contracting the blood vessels of the body, while the large
renal arteries are dilated by two of its active principles,
digitoxin and digitalein. On this account digitalis is an
ideal diuretic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is used as a cardiac stimulant in full doses,
followed by small ones; used in heart and cardiac debility
from any cause, irregularity of the heart due to debility;
used in dropsical conditions, combined with acetate or
nitrate of potash; it is useful in congestion of organs,
useful in the first stages of pneumonia and scarlatina;
as a diuretic over the region of the kidneys this can be
used two or three times daily; when internal remedies
fail to increase the action of the kidneys this is very effectual.
Useful in palpitation of the heart due to overexertion.
Digitalis is occasionally employed with good
results as a poultice of the leaves, applied over the loins
to promote diuresis, or in local inflammation, to contract
blood vessels.</p>

<p>There are 36 official preparations of iron and a number
of unofficial preparations, quite a few of which are
impracticable for use in veterinary medicine, consequently
we have considered only those which are practicable
for use. Some are more irritating than others
and some have special actions due to other drugs combined
with the iron.</p>

<h3>GENERAL ACTION OF IRON AND ITS SALTS</h3>

<p>Iron is not a foreign substance to the organism. It
is constantly present in the blood, gastric juice, lymph,
bile, pigment of the eye and traces of it in the milk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
urine. In man there is 1 part of iron to 230 red blood
corpuscles, and in cattle 1 to 194 red globules. That
it performs a very important part is shown in the rapid
construction of red globules when iron is administered
in anaemia. Without it haematin is not formed and
red globules diminish in number. By its medicinal use
we furnish to the blood a material which it needs. The
action of iron is not limited merely to the construction
of red blood. It also promotes the appetite and invigorates
the digestion when there is no intolerance to its
presence in the stomach. By increasing the disposition
for food and the ability to dispose of it, iron acts as a
stomachic, consequently when given in the healthy state
or when administered for too long a period during disease
the gastric glands become exhausted by over-stimulation;
then it is said that iron disagrees. Being a restorative
its use is contra-indicated in a condition of plethora
(fullness of the blood vessels). In large doses
the soluble preparations of iron give rise to nausea and
vomiting, some of them possessing more or less toxic activity.
The iodide chloride and sulphate are the most
active. Large doses will produce gangrene of the
stomach and intestines. Certain salts of iron, as the
sulphates, nitrates and chlorides, possess a high degree
of astringency, hence they produce constipation when
taken internally. When brought into contact with
blood they coagulate it, forming a tough brownish
magma, and as the albuminous elements of the tissues
are also solidified they are powerful haemostatics. Iron
is eliminated chiefly by the intestinal route, partly by the
liver into the bile, thence into the intestines, some by the
kidneys also. The tincture of the chloride being especially
diuretic.</p>

<p>Iron is a haematinic, stomachic, styptic, astringent
or haemostatic. The tincture chloride in addition is diuretic.
The sulphate is in addition vermicide. The iodide
is alterative and resolvent as well as tonic. A medicine
used in combination with iron may modify or enhance
its action. Externally iron salts contract tissue by coagulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
albumen when applied to raw surfaces or mucous
membranes, and through this means by compressing
the blood vessels from without and plugging them
from within with clotted blood, arrest hemorrhage. The
astringent salts may also induce some contraction of the
vessels besides. Iron in the form of liquor ferri chloridi
or liquor ferri subsulphatis is the most powerful of the
metallic hemostatic agents we possess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses Internally.</span>&mdash;The saccharated carbonate is
staple, non-irritating to the stomach, and especially
suited to dogs. It has the same uses as the sulphate.
It is also used for the other animals when the stomach
is weak.</p>

<p>Sulphate of iron is used locally as an astringent and
internally as a haematinic and tonic in anaemia. It improves
the appetite and abates exhausting discharges,
as in nasal gleet and leucorrhoea. In atonic torpidity
of bowels it is prescribed with aloes; also in the same
way for intestinal worms. Conjoined with iodine it is
the best prescription for diabetes insipidus. It is also
prescribed with good results in the first stages of liver
rot in sheep. Chorea and epilepsy when with anaemia
are benefited by iron. Combined iron and arsenic for
chorea. Septicaemia, pyaemia and all forms of blood
poisoning, as purpura, haemorrhagica, scarlatina, etc.,
with quinine. The tincture chloride is prescribed in
blood poisoning. In red water of cattle, after bowels
are freely opened. In convalescence from debilitating
diseases it is a valuable tonic combined with other medicines
as nux vomica, quinine, etc. Such diseases as influenza,
chest diseases and chronic catarrh should be followed
with iron and other tonics.</p>

<p>Iodide of iron is used when an alterative as well as a
tonic action is desired. It is given to promote the absorption
of glandular enlargements in young and weakly
animals, and in swelling of the joints. It is useful in
polyuria or diabetes insipidus, also nasal gleet.</p>

<p>Tincture chloride of iron acts as a haematinic, tonic,
antiseptic, astringent, styptic, diuretic and local irritant<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
or caustic. It is serviceable in most cases in which the
sulphate is recommended. It is used in atonic dyspepsia
and for the removal of intestinal worms, in relaxed and
sore throat.</p>

<p>Tincture Chloride of iron is also used in anaemia
combined with arsenic or quinine, and in blood poisoning
combined with quinine. It also promotes absorption
of inflammatory material when associated with debility
and anaemia. It is the most serviceable preparation
of iron for influenza, purpura and scarlatina, as it
has a tonic effect on both the blood and arterioles. In
these cases it is prescribed with turpentine, quinine and
oil. It is used in rheumatism in weakly patients alternated
with salol, salicylic acid or salicylate of soda. Also
used as an astringent and stimulant for the genito-urinary
mucous membrane. The tincture being excreted
by the kidneys, is preferred to watery solution.
It is particularly suited for distemper and rheumatic
lameness in weakly dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Externally: Liquor ferri chloridi and liquor
ferri subsulphatis are sometimes used to stop bleeding
from wounds or natural cavities of the body. They
may be injected, applied by swab, or on absorbent material,
which is packed into the wound or cavity. As a
local application in pharyngitis, we use one part of the
solution of ferric chloride with four parts of glycerine.
In the same strength, diluted with water, the chloride
may be injected into the uterus to stop hemorrhage.
Again, a solution in the strength of two drachms to
the pint of water, is employed as an enema to destroy
ascarides. The objection to these solutions of iron is
that they form heavy, nasty, tenacious clots when employed
to arrest hemorrhage, and the clots are apt to
decompose and favor sepsis. Therefore they should not
be used if other means, as ligature, pressure, heat or
cold can be utilized. Iron is regarded as a specific for
erysipelas. It is given both internally and externally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Administration of Iron.</span>&mdash;The fluid preparations
should be freely diluted; the solid preparations should<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
be combined with protectives or inert remedies, either in
powder or capsule form, or with stomachics as gentian
root. Iron causes less gastric irritation and enters the
blood more readily if given with or immediately after
meals. In anaemia it should be given in increased doses.
Overcome constipation by giving when necessary or
combining iron with laxatives as linseed oil.</p>

<h2>GAMBIR&mdash;CATECHU</h2>

<p>An extract prepared from the leaves and twigs of
Ourouparia Gambir (Hunter), Ballon (Fam. Rubiaceae).
U. S. “An extract of the leaves and young
shoots of the Uncaria Gambir, Roxb.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Africa and Southern Asia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;Irregular masses or cubes; reddish-brown,
pale brownish-gray or light brown; fracture dull-earthy;
friable, crystalline; inodorous, bitterish, very astringent,
with a sweetish after-taste; free from starch.
Not less than 70 per cent should be soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Catechutannic acid (about 45 per
cent) is the active principle; it is converted into the
isomeric inactive catchnic acid, or catchin, by the saliva
and by boiling, a red color being developed. There is
also pyrocatechin or catechol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Incompatibles.</span>&mdash;Alkalies, metallic salts and gelatine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 gr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>TINCTURA GAMBIR COMPOSITA&mdash;COMPOUND
TINCTURE OF GAMBIR</h4>

<p>Composed of gambir, 50; cinnamon, 25; alcohol to
make 1000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 oz.; cattle, 1 to 3 oz.; sheep
and pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; calves and foals, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; lambs,
10 to 30 m.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr. The above doses can be
considerably increased and are good in cases of diarrhoea
of small and young animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses</span>.&mdash;Gambir is administered to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
classes of domestic animals for the arrest of chronic
catarrhal discharges and haemorrhage, especially from
the alimentary canal. The insoluble catechnic acid
beneficially exerts its astringency on the relaxed, over-secreting
surfaces alike of small and large intestines.
In chronic diarrhoea and in dysentery it is combined
with aromatics to allay flatulence; with opium to relieve
irritability and spasm; with alkalies, magnesia, or chalk
to counteract acidity.</p>

<p>If there is much mucus in the fecal discharges, showing
a catarrhal state of the intestinal mucous membrane,
it is advisable to give oil, salts or calomel before checking
up the bowels with an astringent.</p>

<h2>GENTIANA&mdash;GENTIAN</h2>

<p>Gentian is obtained from the root Gentiana lutae.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Mountainous parts of Southern and
Central Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Odor strong, characteristic; taste
slightly sweetish, strongly and persistently bitter. The
powder is free from starch grains and sclerenchymatic
tissues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 gr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTUM GENTIANAE&mdash;EXTRACT OF
GENTIAN</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with water and
evaporated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 30 gr. to 1 dr.; cattle, 1 to 2 dr.;
sheep and pigs, 20 to 40 gr.; dogs, 1 to 3 gr.</p>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM OF GENTIANAE&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF GENTIAN</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with dilute alcohol
and evaporated, so that 1 c. c. equals 1 gm. of the
crude drug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 m.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span></p>

<h4>TINCTURA GENTIANAE COMPOSITA&mdash;COMPOUND
TINCTURE OF GENTIAN</h4>

<p>Composed of gentian, 100 parts; bitter orange peel,
40 parts; cardamon, 10 parts; made by maceration and
percolation with alcohol and water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 4 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 dr. to 1 oz.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Gentian is a pure bitter, and is
prescribed as a stomachic and tonic for all classes of animals.
Gentian improves the appetite and general tone.
In atonic indigestion it is particularly useful amongst
young animals, and in such cases is often conjoined with
ginger and sodium bicarbonate. In relaxed and irritable
states of the bowels and where intestinal worms
are suspected, after administration of a laxative, gentian
and dilute hydrochloric acid are of service. For
horses suffering from simple catarrh few combinations
are more effectual than an ounce of powdered gentian,
two drachms potassium nitrate with two ounces of magnesium
sulphate, dissolved in a pint of linseed tea, repeated
morning and night. Where more general tonic
effects are sought, iron sulphate is alternated with the
gentian and salines. Gentian proves an excellent stomachic
and stimulating tonic in influenza and other epizootics,
helps convalescence from exhausting disorders
and is a useful restorative for horses, overworked or
suffering from loss of appetite or slight cold. The powdered
gentian should be added to aloes when given in
full cathartic doses to horses.</p>

<h2>HYDRARGYRI CHLORIDUM CORROSIVUM&mdash;CORROSIVE
MERCURIC CHLORIDE&mdash;BICHLORIDE
OF MERCURY&mdash;CORROSIVE
SUBLIMATE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Bichloride of mercury is obtained as a sulphate
by heating a mixture of mercuric sulphate, sodium
chloride and a little black oxide of manganese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Heavy, colorless masses; soluble one<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
in sixteen of water, one in three of alcohol; hydrochloric
acid or muriate of ammonia increases its solubility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;It is a corrosive, irritant poison; it is
occasionally prescribed as an alterative, antiseptic and
hepatic stimulant; repeated doses or long continued produce
mercurialism. Externally, it is used as an antiseptic,
astringent, caustic and parasiticide. It is a most
powerful antiseptic when five parts of tartaric acid are
added to one part of bichloride of mercury, which prevents
the formation of insoluble albuminates of mercury
in the tissues which checks any further action of
the drug. Hydrochloric acid equal parts serves the
same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;For internal use milder preparations of mercury
are preferred, and it is dangerous to use it for the
production of mercurialism. For horses it has been prescribed
in tetanus, chronic skin eruptions and swollen
oedematous legs following repeated attacks of lymphangitis.
Its chief use is that of an antiseptic externally for
many surgical purposes, usually in the strength of one
to five hundred, one to one thousand; for uterine injections,
one to five thousand or one in ten thousand. Seven
and a half grains to a pint of water makes a one to one
thousand solution. Seven and a half grains to a quart
of water makes a one to two thousand solution. Fifteen
grains to a pint of water makes a one to five hundred
solution. Instruments, sponges, towels as well as the
hands are disinfected by washing in a one thousandth
solution. But it is injurious to most metal instruments
and irritates and roughens the operator’s hands. Best
antiseptic for foul wounds, thrush, poll-evil, quittor and
fistulous withers and nail punctures of the feet, a one in
five hundred to one in one thousand solution to destroy
the cryptogamic growths of ringworm, to kill lice and
allay the itching of puritis and urticaria. Bichloride of
mercury one part in one or two thousand parts of water
is injected into the uterus in metritis, and in cases of
abortion with good results. Contagious abortion is satisfactorily
prevented by washing the aborted anima<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>l’s
tail and external genital organs twice daily. All pregnant
cows should be treated in the same manner. Warm
solutions are much more active than cold.</p>

<p>A one in three to five thousand solutions are used in
purulent conjunctivitis or wounds of the eye and lids, by
frequently saturating absorbent cotton in the solution
and holding over the eye by means of a clean cloth or
bandage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horse, 1 to 5 gr.; cattle, 2 to 8 gr.; sheep,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 gr.; pigs <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>60</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> gr.
Not often given internally. It is the best of all the
preparations of mercury for hypodermic use in syphilitic
diseases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antidotes.</span>&mdash;The white of eggs, stomach pump for
horses and emesis for dogs; wheat flower, milk, etc.</p>

<h3>HYDRARGYRI CHLORIDUM MITE&mdash;MILD
MERCUROUS CHLORIDE&mdash;CALOMEL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Calomel is obtained by heating a mixture
of mercurous sulphate and sodium chlorid. Calomel is
found native in Spain and Carniola, but in too small
quantities for commercial value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Calomel is a dull-white heavy powder.
It is inodorous, insoluble in water, alcohol or ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Calomel is a cathartic, laxative, alterative,
diuretic and vermifuge. Small doses are laxatives
when repeated, large doses are cathartics, full doses
irritate the stomach and produce emesis in man and dog.
By stimulating the urea functions of the liver diuresis
are produced, its action on the liver does not directly
increase the secretion of bile, but removes it from the
duodenum which reflexly increases its secretion. Repeated
doses produce mercurial poisoning. It is an
alterative when combined with opium, laxative in small
repeated doses and cathartic in larger doses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Calomel is useful in gastric and intestinal
catarrh, bilious diarrhoea, influenza lymphangitis and
liver disorders which show themselves by a yellowness
of the visible mucous membranes. It is a useful adjuvant
cathartic conjoined with aloes or other cathartics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
As a laxative or cathartic for horses give aloes and
calomel; cattle and sheep, magnesium and sodium sulphate;
for pigs, dogs and cats with jalap. Pure calomel
is a specific for thrush. It is also useful in the treatment
of moist skin and raw sores, mixed in equal parts with
bismuth subnitrate it quickly dries the flesh and prevents
itching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;As a laxative vermifuge and alterative
horses and cattle take 20 to 40 grs.; sheep and pigs, 5
to 20 grs.; dogs and cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> to 1 gr., given two or
three times a day with equal weight of opium which
prevents griping and a too rapid removal by the bowels.
As a cathartic, calomel is best conjoined with other medicines
regulated by that of the medicine with which it is
conjoined. A full cathartic for horses should consist
of calomel 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drs. with aloes 4 to 6 drs.; cattle,
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 drs. with magnesium sulphate or sodium sulphate
1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pounds; sheep, 5 to 30 grs. with magnesium
sulphate 4 to 8 ounces; pigs, 5 to 30 grs. with sodium
bicarbonate <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 ounce; dogs and cats <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to 10 grs.
with jalap 10 to 30 grains.</p>

<h3>HYDRARGYRI IODIDUM RUBRUM&mdash;RED
IODIDE OF MERCURY&mdash;BINIODIDE
OF MERCURY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Red iodide of mercury is obtained by dissolving
in water separately bichloride of mercury and
potassium iodide, and pour both solutions slowly and
stirring actively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A scarlet-red, amorphous powder;
odorless and tasteless; permanent in air, insoluble in
water; soluble in one hundred and twenty-five parts of
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Red iodide of mercury is a stimulant
irritant, resolvent pustulant antiseptic and parasiticide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Mixed with one to eight parts of lard it is
a blister used to reduce bony enlargements or bone-tumors
as in splints, bone spavin, ringbone, sidebone
and actinomycosis; it is also used with good results in
reducing soft swellings, to arrest chronic inflammation<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
and promote absorption of inflammatory deposits, as
seen in sprained tendons, curbs, enlarged joints, bursae,
etc. It is frequently used as a counter-irritant in sore
throat, chronic cough and roaring. Mixed with cantharides
the strength can be reduced as an irritant and
less apt to permanently destroy the hair bulbs. It is
used internally to arrest the growths of actinomycoses
and scirrhous cord, but in those cases the benefits are
derived from the potassium iodide which it contains, and
I would recommend administering internally without
the mercury.</p>

<h3>HYDRARGYRI OXIDUM FLAVUM&mdash;YELLOW
MERCURIC OXIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Yellow mercuric oxide is obtained by
the interaction of mercuric chloride and sodium hydroxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Mercuric oxide is of a yellow color,
similar to that of the yolk of egg, and is a completely
amorphous powder; odorless, and having a somewhat
metallic taste; permanent in the air, but turning dark
on exposure to light; insoluble in water or alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;A stimulant caustic and anesthetic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;The official ointment of yellow mercuric
oxide is prescribed as a stimulant and anesthetic in
chronic inflammation and ulceration of the eye (4 gr. of
yellow mercuric oxide to 1 oz. of vaseline). It is also
employed on skin diseases, indolent ulcers, swollen
glands and granulated wounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 6 grs.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grs.; dogs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;It acts like the simple bitters,
promotes appetite and aids digestion, increases nutrition
and stimulates secretion, especially of the intestines and
liver. It is a stomach tonic, laxative, slightly diuretic
and hepatic stimulant. It is also said to promote uterine
constructions, and has some power as an antispasmodic.
Externally it is an antiseptic and astringent. Useful in
conjunctivitis, nasal gleet and leucorrhoea; one to two
drachms of the fluid extract or glycerite to the ounce
of distilled water. One to two drachms of the fluidextract
of hydrastis to one ounce of water is useful as a
gargle for sore throat. Equal parts of fluidextract of
ergot and fluidextract of hydrastis is useful in ulceration
of the uterus, vagina and in eversion of the rectum. Useful
internally during convalescence after debilitating diseases,
as in influenza and distemper, or whenever a bitter
tonic is indicated, as in dyspepsia, chronic gastric
catarrh, catarrhal jaundice, constipation from chronic
nephritis and chronic cystitis. The glycerite applied
locally for fissure of teats, cracked heels. Where
there is a tendency to constipation it should be used as a
bitter in preference to gentian, etc.</p>

<h2>IODUM&mdash;IODINE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Iodine exists in certain marine vegetables,
particularly the fuci or common sea weeds, which
have long been its most abundant natural source. Iodine
is also found in the animal kingdom, as in the
sponge, oysters, cod liver oil and eggs, and in the mineral
kingdom, in sea water in small quantities, in certain
salt springs. It is obtained commercially from one
of these sources.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Iodine is heavy, bluish-black color, dry
and friable, rhombic plates, having a metallic
luster, a distinctive odor, and a sharp and acrid taste.
Iodine imparts a deep brown, evanescent stain to the
skin, and slowly destroys vegetable colors. Soluble in
about 5000 parts of water and in 10 parts of alcohol<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
at 77° F., freely soluble in ether, chloroform or carbon
disulphide; its solution in alcohol or in an aqueous solution
of potassium iodide has a reddish color; its solution
in chloroform or carbon disulphide has a violet color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Iodine internally is an antiseptic, alterative,
resolvent and irritant. Full doses persisted will
produce a state of debility and emaciation termed iodism.
Externally it is applied as an antiseptic, disinfectant,
parasiticide, deodorant, stimulant, desquamatic, absorbent
and counter-irritant. Iodine is one of the best antiseptics
for surgical purposes. The tincture iodine especially
kills all disease producing bacteria in one minute,
whereas it takes a one in one thousandth solution of
bichloride of mercury more than half an hour to destroy
the same micro-organisms. The tincture of iodine
also possesses unusual penetrating power on the dry
skin, finding its way into the hair follicles and cutaneous
glands. Iodine must not be applied to the wetted skin
because the wetting causes the skin cells to swell and
thus prevent the iodine from penetrating into the sebaceous
and sudoriparous glands, the very action upon
which the special germicidal action depends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Iodine is of most value applied externally, or
locally. In sterilizing the skin for an emergency operation
the hair should be clipped and shaved dry and the
tincture of iodine applied without washing the skin.
For other operations the skin may be scrubbed with
soap and shaved and dried before applying the tincture.
The tincture should always dry on the skin before the
operation is begun.</p>

<p>The method used in human surgery for sterilizing
the skin, and recommended by leading surgeons, consists
in first of cleansing the skin with gasoline to remove
the grease and then applying the tincture of iodine in
full or half strength.</p>

<p>Tincture of iodine applied is of some value in the
treatment of periostitis with osseous deposits, as splints,
bone-spavin, ringbone, sidebones, etc. It is used for enlargements
of glands as goiter in dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span></p>

<h2>LINUM&mdash;LINSEED&mdash;FLAXSEED</h2>

<p>Ground linseed (linseed meal or flaxseed meal)
should be recently prepared and free from unpleasant
or rancid odor. It is a grayish-yellow powder containing
brownish fragments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;It is nutrient, tonic, laxative,
emollient and demulcent. Linseed meal and the cake
are valuable foodstuffs in small quantities. It is two
and one-half times as fattening as starch or sugar. It
causes the hair of an animal to become slick and glossy
and induces shedding in the spring, but is very heating
in summer. Linseed gruel is a food, being palatable
and easily digested, for horses, cattle and sheep, not only
good in health, but in debilitating diseases, also in chronic
skin diseases. It acts in such cases both as food and
medicine. In febrile diseases horses will often sip or
drink cold linseed tea (linseed meal two ounces to one
pint of water) when they will not touch anything else.
When a patient is exhausted the linseed tea is given with
milk, eggs and whisky. Horses that are poor feeders,
having harsh scurvy skins, or being affected with roaring,
thick wind or heaves, are usually much benefited
with linseed in some form. A mucilaginous demulcent
in the proportion of about one to two ounces to a pint of
warm water, is useful in irritable conditions of the
throat, alimentary canal, kidneys and bladder.</p>

<p>For linseed poultices, take the best grade of linseed
meal, pour hot water over it until it becomes pasty.
Charcoal and antiseptics are often mixed with it. When
used as a poultice on the foot in nail pricks, always put
on a poultice that will cover the whole foot.</p>

<h3>OLEUM LINI&mdash;LINSEED OIL&mdash;OIL OF
FLAXSEED</h3>

<p>A fixed oil expressed from flaxseed without the use
of heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A yellowish or yellow, oily liquid, having
a slight, peculiar odor and bland taste. Soluble in<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
about ten parts of absolute alcohol and in all proportions
in ether, chloroform, benzine or oil of turpentine.</p>

<p>Linseed oil for medicine should always be used raw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 2 pints; cattle, 2 to 4 pints;
sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 ozs.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 3 ozs.; cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Linseed oil cannot be used as a
diet on account of its being too laxative; it is laxative in
small doses, but in large doses produces copious discharges
of faeces, having a distinct linseed oil smell.
The oil is also emollient, soothing and softening to inflamed
and indurated surfaces. As a laxative it usually
produces tolerably full and softened evacuations,
without nausea, griping or superpurgation and with decided
odor of oil. It is the best physic to administer to
pregnant animals and in irritable conditions of the
bowels; also in cases of influenza, purpura and other debilitating
diseases, where the usual purgatives would be
too severe, irritating and exhausting. It is also used as
an enema; two to four ounces of the oil or meal given
daily in mash often suffices to maintain the bowels in
a relaxed condition throughout febrile attacks, where
there is a tendency to constipation. An ounce or two
of oil given daily often relieves broken wind in horses.
For burns and scalds the well known <i>carron oil</i>, composed
of equal parts of linseed oil and lime water, cannot
be surpassed. This oil is also used as a vehicle for
acrid medicines and to act as a protective to the alimentary
tract in poisoning of corrosive medicines, also to
sweep them out. Carron oil in two to four ounce doses
two to three times daily will often relieve “heaves” in
horses.</p>

<p>Linseed oil is frequently given to ruminants, although
Epsom salts is generally the best purge for them.
It is indicated for these animals when a milder operation
than that obtained by a full dose of salts is required, and
for its demulcent action in irritable states of the digestive
organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<h2>MAGNESII SULPHAS&mdash;MAGNESIUM SULPHATE&mdash;EPSOM
SALTS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Magnesium sulphate is a constituent
of sea water and of some saline springs. It also occurs
native, either crystallized in slender, prismatic, adhering
crystals, or as an efflorescence on certain rocks and soils
which contain magnesia and a sulphate or sulphide. In
the United States it is found in the great caves so numerous
to the west of the Alleghany Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Small, colorless, rhombic prisms, or
acicular crystals, without color and having a cooling,
saline and bitter taste; slowly efflorescent in dry air;
.85 part of water; insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Magnesium sulphate is a hydragogue
and cholagogue cathartic; alterative and febrifuge and
is also feebly diuretic and diaphoretic. As a cathartic
it resembles common and glauber salts, and is more active
than potassium bitartrate or sodium phosphate.
When magnesium sulphate is administered it causes
outpouring of secretion from the walls of the
small intestines, most quickly and abundantly when
the bowels have been partially emptied by several hours’
fasting. Neither pancreatic fluid nor bile is materially
increased. But magnesium sulphate has a low diffusing
power. It is slowly absorbed, and moreover, retards
diffusion and absorption of fluid present in the bowels.
In this twofold action by increased secretion and retarded
absorption the fluid contents of the bowels are increased,
producing more or less mechanical distension
and provoking, like other salines, slight peristalsis. The
retarded removal of accumulating liquid is apt to produce
the formation of gases in the bowels, which is relieved
by conjoining carminatives, as ginger or capsicum,
while effectual removal of the intestinal fluids is attained
by using with magnesium sulphate aloes, calomel or oil.
It acts in from twelve to sixteen hours; in small doses
it stimulates the secretions of the kidneys and skin. In
febrile diseases it is used in small repeated doses. It is
valuable in treating animals suffering from reflex skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
irritation, combined with large doses of bicarbonate of
sodium, generally gives relief, especially in urticaria of
the horse. It is quite commonly used as a cathartic for
horses, but most often for cattle and sheep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;When repeated two or three times as a laxative
and alterative horses take 2 to 4 ounces, cattle 3 to
6 ounces, sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 drachms. As a cathartic
cattle take 1 to 2 pounds, calves two to three months
old 3 to 4 ounces, sheep 4 to 6 ounces, dogs 1 to 4
drachms. Aloes is a much better cathartic for horses,
and castor or linseed oil acts much better as a cathartic
in pigs.</p>

<h2>NAPHTHALENUM&mdash;NAPHTHALENE</h2>

<p>A by-product of gas manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, shining rhombic crystals of
an aromatic acrid taste, insoluble in water but soluble in
alcohol, ether and oils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 1 to 3 dr.; cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; sheep
and pigs, 5 to 15 gr.; dogs, 1 to 10 gr. These doses can
be doubled in severe cases of intestinal flatulence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions and Uses.</span>&mdash;A true intestinal antiseptic and
antiferment, is also expectorant, antiseptic and parasiticide.
Used in intestinal flatulence, dissolved in tincture
capsicum; in diarrhoea and dysentery, is of great
value in these ailments, quickly allays foul odor of the
evacuations of the bowels; large doses irritate the kidneys
and cause bloody urine which ceases upon withholding
the drug. When powdered on a wound as wire
cuts, etc., will keep away flies and other insects, besides
it is a powerful antiseptic and promotes the healing
of wounds. Used as an ointment it is very effective
in parasitic skin diseases.</p>

<h2>NUX VOMICA&mdash;QUAKER BUTTON</h2>

<p>The dried ripe seeds of Strychnos nux vomica, yielding
when assayed by the process given below, not less
than 1.25 per cent of strychnine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;The tree is a native of the East Indies,
growing in Bengal, Malabar, on the Coromandel Coast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
in Ceylon, in many islands of the Indian Archipelago,
in Cochin-China and in other neighboring countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description.</span>&mdash;Orbicular, nearly flat, sometimes irregularly
bent, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter
and two in thickness; externally grayish or greenish-gray,
the surface covered with short closely oppressed,
satiny hairs; rounded or somewhat acute at the
margin, with a slight ridge extending from the center
of one side to the edge; internally whitish-gray, horny,
very tough, the endosperm in two more or less regular
concavo-convex halves, between which, at one end, lie the
heart-shaped, palmately nerved cotyledons; inodorous;
taste intensely and persistently bitter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Two alkaloids. 1. Strychnine,
0.2-0.6 per cent. 2. Brucine, 0.5-1.0 per cent.
Similar in action to strychnine, but weaker and slower.
Both alkaloids exist in combination with igasuric acid.
Brucine occurs in rectangular octohedral crystals; it is
soluble in alcohol, in 7 parts of chloroform, and possesses
a bitter taste. With sulphuric and nitric acids
a beautiful blood-red color is developed. There are
also: 4. Igasuric acid with which strychnine and brucine
are combined. 5. Loganin, an inert glucoside occurring
in colorless prisms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Of the ground seeds, horses and cattle, 1 to
2 dr.; sheep, 20 to 40 gr.; pigs, 10 to 20 gr.; dogs, 1 to
2 gr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTUM NUCIS VOMICAE&mdash;EXTRACT
OF NUX VOMICA</h4>

<p>Made by maceration with alcohol, water and acetic
acid; percolation with alcohol and water and evaporation.
Standardized to contain 5 per cent of strychnine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 5 to 15 gr.; sheep, 2 to
5 gr.; pigs, 1 to 2 gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> gr.</p>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM NUCIS VOMICAE&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF NUX VOMICA</h4>

<p>Made by digestion and percolation with alcohol and
water and acetic acid. The alcohol is distilled off and<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
the solution evaporated. Alcohol and water are added
so that the fluid extract shall contain one per cent of
strychnine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 dr.; sheep, 20 to
30 m.; pigs, 10 to 20 m.; dogs, 1 to 2 m.</p>

<h4>TINCTURA NUCIS VOMICAE&mdash;TINCTURE OF
NUX VOMICA</h4>

<p>Made by solution of the extract of nux vomica, 20
in alcohol, and water to make 1000. Standardized to
contain 0.1 per cent strychnine.</p>

<h4>STRYCHNINA&mdash;STRYCHNINE</h4>

<p>An alkaloid obtained from nux vomica, and also
obtainable from other plants of the natural order Loganiaceae.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Nux vomica seeds are powdered and
strychnine is extracted with water acidulated with hydrochloric
acid. The solution is concentrated and
strychnine precipitated with lime. It is then redissolved
in boiling alcohol and the crystals are deposited upon
concentration of the solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent, prismatic crystals,
or a white crystalline powder; odorless, having an
intensely bitter taste, perceptible even in solutions of
1 in 700,000. Strychnine should be tasted with extreme
caution. Permanent in the air, soluble in water, alcohol,
ether, chloroform, benzine and amyl alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as strychnine sulphate.</p>

<h4>STRYCHNINAE SULPHAS&mdash;STRYCHNINE
SULPHATE</h4>

<p>Made by the action of sulphuric acid on strychnine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless or white, prismatic crystals,
odorless and having an intensely bitter taste. Efflorescent
in dry air. Soluble in water and alcohol. Almost
soluble in ether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; cattle, 1 to 3 gr.;
sheep, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; dogs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>120</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> gr. The small
doses are to be used when strychnine is given subcutaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Nerve tonic, stomach tonic, stimulates
respiration, secretion, appetite and digestion; it increases
peristalsis, stimulates both the motor and inhibitory apparatus
of the heart, and raises arterial tension by stimulating
the vaso-motor centers, thus contracting the arterioles,
though full doses relax the arterioles and thus
lower blood pressure.</p>

<p>Strychnine exalts all functions of the spinal cord,
reflex, motor, vaso-motor and sensory, the latter being
the least affected; it does not affect the brain directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toxicology.</span>&mdash;Large doses cause trembling and
twitching of the voluntary and involuntary muscles with
violent clonic spasms, lasting one or two minutes, gradually
getting more frequent and severe in form involving
the glottis, diaphragm and other muscles of respiration;
causes death usually from asphyxia. Very large
doses may paralyze the cord as from a blow, and cause
almost instant death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Nux vomica or strychnine is indicated in any
condition in which there is a paralysis or depressed state
of the nerves or nervous system; atonic dyspepsia,
broken wind, relaxed condition of the bowels due to lack
of tone, in small doses.</p>

<p>In weak condition of the heart give with small doses
of digitalis; it stimulates sexual organs. Give it in
convalescence from debilitating diseases, also as an aid
to recovery during their progress; in collapse and for
narcotic poisoning strychnine hypodermically in paralysis,
whether of limbs, intestines or bladder.</p>

<p>In diarrhoea, due to lack of tone of muscular coat
of the bowels combined with astringents; for anaemia,
strychnine combined with iron and quinine; nervous
coughs use strychnine with sedatives; also in incontinuence
of urine and chorea, in dogs after distemper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antidote for Strychnine Poisoning.</span>&mdash;Tannic
acid or vegetables containing it should be freely administered,
for the tannate of strychnine which is formed is
very insoluble; an emetic or the stomach pump must be
used promptly. The tetanic spasms are best controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
by chloral hydrate or very large doses of potassium
bromide (2 dr. to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz. for man) or 4 to 8 ounces for
the horse as antidote for strychnine poisoning. Inhalations
of ether are also recommended. Chloral hydrate
may be used per rectum or intravenously. Inhalations
of amyl nitrate are also of value. The administration
of melted lard seems to exert peculiar antidotal properties
to strychnine poisoning. As an emetic for dogs
apomorphinae hydrochloras <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> grain, given
hypodermically, is the best and may have to be pushed
as emetics act tardily in poisoning by this drug.</p>

<h2>OLEUM MORRHUAE&mdash;COD LIVER OIL</h2>

<p>A fixed oil obtained from the fresh livers of cod fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;North Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale yellow, thin, oily liquid, having
a peculiar slightly fishy but not rancid odor, and a
bland, slightly fishy taste. Cod liver oil is often adulterated
with the oil of other fish. Brown oils are not
desirable therapeutically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 oz.; cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep, 1 oz.;
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; dogs, 1 to 4 dr.; cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Nutrient, tonic and alterative;
on account of its biliary constituents is easily emulsified
and digested. It is indicated in all cases of malnutritions
and where the digestive organs are weak; also in
animals recovering from debilitating diseases, such as
distemper and influenza. It is good in catarrh and
bronchitis, as it appears to furnish suitable material
for repair of the inflamed mucous membranes. Like
other oils it relieves broken wind and is given to man
in consumption. It is particularly used for the smaller
animals. It is given to dogs and cats during distemper,
also in eczema, epilepsy, chorea, rickets and chronic rheumatism.</p>

<h2>OLEUM OLIVAE&mdash;OLIVE OIL&mdash;SWEET OIL</h2>

<p>A fixed oil expressed from the ripe fruit of Olea
europaea Linne. It should be kept in well stoppered
bottles in a cool place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Southern Europe and Asia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale yellow, or light greenish-yellow,
oily liquid, having a slightly peculiar odor and a
nutty oleaginous taste, with a faintly acrid after-taste.
Very sparingly soluble in alcohol, but readily soluble
in ether and chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;As a laxative&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 pt.;
dogs, 2 to 4 oz.</p>

<h2>OLEUM GOSSYPII SEMINIS&mdash;COTTON SEED
OIL</h2>

<p>A fixed oil expressed from the seeds of Gossypium
herbaceum Linne and of other species of Gossypium and
subsequently purified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Southern United States and other semitropical
countries; cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale yellow, oily liquid, without
odor and having a bland nut-like taste. Very sparingly
soluble in alcohol, but readily soluble in ether, chloroform
or carbon disulphide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as olive oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Both olive and cotton seed oil
are laxative tonics, demulcents and emollients. Sweet
oil, not used internally to any extent, but is used externally
for soothing and healing irritated wounds. It may
be used in its pure state or be mixed with carbolic acid,
20 m. of the carbolic acid to 4 oz. of sweet oil.</p>

<h2>OLEUM RICINI&mdash;CASTOR OIL</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Castor oil is expressed from the seeds
of a plant (Ricinus communis) which grows in the East
Indies and Africa in the character of a tree and rises
sometimes thirty or forty feet. It also grows in the
temperate latitudes of North America and Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Pure castor oil is a thick, viscid, colorless
liquid, with little or no odor and a mild though somewhat
nauseous taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Good castor oil is a mild and
speedy cathartic, usually operating within four to five
hours with little griping or uneasiness, and evacuating<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
the contents of the bowels without much increasing the
alvine secretions. Hence it is particularly applicable
to constipation from collections of abnormally hard
faeces, and to cases in which irritating substances have
been swallowed or irritating substances have accumulated
in the bowels. From its mildness it is also especially
adapted to diseases of the bowels, as colic, indigestion,
diarrhoea, dysentery and enteritis. It is also
indicated in overloaded bowels in pregnancy combined
with anodynes and antispasmodics to prevent griping.
Castor oil in two or three ounce doses conjoined with
gruel and five or six drops of oil of peppermint is suitable
for foals and calves affected with gastro-intestinal
disorders. Castor oil is specially applicable in canine
practice, to evacuate the bowels, and in irritated conditions
of the digestive tract, in ounce doses mixed with
equal parts of glycerine and adding two or three drops
of oil of wintergreen.</p>

<p>Castor oil may be given to horses in sixteen ounce
doses conjoined with oil of peppermint, twenty drops,
or tincture opium, one ounce and fluidextract of belladonna,
one to two drachms, flour gruel, etc.</p>

<p>Castor oil in one to two drachm doses is especially
valuable for poultry.</p>

<p>Castor oil is used with equal success in the treatment
of gastro-intestinal disorders of cattle, sheep and pigs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 12 to 16 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 6 oz.; dogs and cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 oz.; poultry, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 2 dr.</p>

<h2>OLEUM TEREBINTHINAE&mdash;OIL OF TURPENTINE<br />
Erroneously Called Spirits of Turpentine</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A concrete oleo-resin from Pinus
palustris Miller, and from other species of Pinus. The
oil is distilled, usually by the use of steam, from the oleo-resin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Southern United States, from Virginia
to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A thin, colorless liquid,
having a characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
odor and taste. Soluble in three times its
volume of alcohol; also soluble in an equal volume of
glacial acetic acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Carminative&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.;

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>LINIMENTUM TERBINTHINAE&mdash;TURPENTINE
LINIMENT</h4>

<p>Composed of resin cerate, 650 parts; oil of turpentine,
350 parts; melt the resin cerate and add the oil of
turpentine.</p>

<h4>OLEUM TEREBINTHINAE RECTIFICATUM&mdash;RECTIFIED
OIL OF TURPENTINE</h4>

<p>Made by slaking oil of turpentine with an equal
volume of Solution of Sodium Hydroxide, and distillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A thin, colorless liquid, having the
same properties as oil of turpentine and should be the
one used for internal use.</p>

<h3>DERIVATIVES OF TURPENTINE</h3>

<h4>TEREBENUM&mdash;TEREBENE</h4>

<p>Made by the action of sulphuric acid on oil of turpentine
and by distillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless, or slightly yellowish, thin
liquid, having a rather agreeable thyme-like odor, and
an aromatic, somewhat terebinthinated taste. Only
slightly soluble in water, but soluble in three times its
volume of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 5 to 15
m. Dilute same as oil of turpentine.</p>

<h4>TERPINI HYDRAS&mdash;TERPIN HYDRATE</h4>

<p>The hydrate of the diatomic alcohol Terpin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Rectified oil of turpentine, alcohol<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
and nitric acid are mixed together in a shallow porcelain
dish, and after three or four days terpin hydrate
crystallizes out. The crystals are collected, drained,
dried on absorbent paper and purified by recrystallization
in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, crystals, odorless, having a
somewhat bitter taste. Soluble in 200 parts of water,
10 parts of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Externally&mdash;Oil of turpentine is rubefacient,
irritant and counter-irritant; vesicant if rubbed
in or confined, also a powerful antiseptic and disinfectant;
is absorbed by the unbroken skin.</p>

<p>Internally&mdash;Is diuretic, stimulant, carminative, antispasmodic,
hemostatic and anthelmintic; it is irritant, and
large undiluted doses may cause gastro-enteritis and
paralysis of nerve centers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;In colic, both spasmodic and flatulent; for
worms, give full doses, septic fevers; gangrene of the
lungs; catarrhal conditions, pneumonia and bronchitis;
as a diuretic, but others not as irritant are better.</p>

<p>For local gangrene remove the dead tissue and then
apply the turpentine direct to the affected parts by
means of absorbent cotton or cloth saturated with it; the
offensive odor is removed and sloughing arrested. For
tape worm it is given with oleo-resin of aspidium, in oil.
As an inhalation in pulmonary diseases one-half ounce
is added to three quarts of boiling water. In two
drachm doses every three hours, if frequently, aborts
suppuration in parotiditis of horses. In purpura haemorrhagica,
turpentine is a valuable medicine as a vaso-motor
stimulant and diuretic, given in two drachm doses
every four hours with tincture chloride of iron and
linseed oil.</p>

<h2>OLEUM TIGLII&mdash;CROTON OIL</h2>

<p>A fixed oil expressed from the seed of Croton Tiglium
Linne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;Asia, India, Indian Archipelago and
Philippine Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A pale yellow or brownish-yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
somewhat viscid, and slightly fluorescent liquid, having
a slight fatty odor, and a mild, oily afterwards acrid
and burning taste (great caution is necessary in tasting).
Specific gravity 0.935 to 0.950 at 25° C. (77°
F.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Crotonoleic acid is the purgative
principal. A small amount is free in the oil but it is
mostly formed within the bowels. It resembles acid
of castor oil in its chemistry; crotonol is a non-purgative
body causing irritation of the skin; tiglinic acid and
other volatile acids existing as glycerides and accounting
for the odor of croton oil; it also contains free and combined
fatty acids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 15 to 30 m.; cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.;
sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;It is a powerful irritant and pustulant,
is a drastic hydragogue cathartic; full doses cause gastro-enteritis
and much prostration; undiluted it seriously
and deeply inflames the skin, causing severe blemishes
and by absorption it may cause fever and superpurgation.
The purgative action is probably due in part to
direct irritation of the intestinal mucous membrane; in
part to absorption and elimination of the purgative principle
by the bowels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Cattle are the only animals for which it can
be used with any degree of safety; it can be used for
dogs and pigs if used with great caution. For horses
and sheep it is too irritating and depressing; it is used in
cattle as an active hydragogue purgative when they suffer
from lodgment of fecal matter in the third stomach
and other forms of constipation, and from torpidity of
the bowels. Should not be used in debilitated, delicate
or young animals. If an over-dose has been given combat
with demulcents, opium and stimulants. It should
not be used as a counter-irritant or applied to the skin
in any form or for any purpose. Croton oil (in a pint
of linseed oil) is valuable in assisting the action of salts
in obstinate constipation of cattle. It may be given to
horses when a powerful derivative and purgative action<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
is indicated, as in acute inflammation of the brain and
spinal cord with calomel and aloes in a capsule.</p>

<h2>OPIUM</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The concrete, milky exudate obtained
by incising the unripe capsules of Papaver somniferum
Linne, and yielding in its normal, moist condition, not
less than nine per cent of crystallized morphine when
assayed by the official process. Opium is imported from
Turkey, Asia Minor, Persia, India and Egypt. The
Smyrna, or Turkey opium, is the more common variety
used in the United States. It occurs in irregular, globular
masses, covered with poppy leaves and capsules
of a species of dock, weighing from one-half to one
pound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;In irregular, flattened, more or less
rounded masses of variable size, externally grayish-brown,
covered with particles of poppy leaves and with
occasional fruits of a species of Rumex; more or less
plastic when fresh, but becoming hard on keeping; internally
dark brown, somewhat lustrous; odor strong, narcotic;
taste bitter and characteristic. It yields its medical
properties to water, alcohol and dilute acids, forming
dark brown solutions. Ether extracts its principles
in part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;There are about nineteen or twenty
alkaloids derived from opium, but only a few are of any
importance so far as their medical value is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Of the crude opium&mdash;Horses, 1 to 2 dr.;

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.</p>

<h4>HEROIN&mdash;DIACETYLMORPHINE</h4>

<p>This drug is a derivative of morphine, and is now
used extensively in human medicine as a substitute for
morphine and codeine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White or colorless, crystalline powder,
possessing a slightly bitter taste. Insoluble in water,
but readily soluble in weak acidous solutions.
Heroin hydrochloride is a white, crystalline powder,
odorless, soluble in 2 parts of water. Heroin surpasses
both morphine and codeine therapeutically in many
ways. It increases markedly the inspiratory and expiratory
force, while lessening the number of the respiratory
movements and exerts a special sedative influence
on the respiratory mucous membranes. The drug
acts also as a general motor depressant, hypnotic and
analgesic, but is not comparable to morphine in these
respects. Heroin is about five times more toxic for dogs
than morphine. Heroin is particularly valuable in the
treatment of all varieties of coughs affecting the dog.
The after-effects of small doses are not as nauseating
or constipating as morphine.</p>

<p>Heroin can be given in powder, pill or tablet, the
Heroin hydrochloride in solution, every three or four
hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose of Either.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 2 gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>24</sub>
to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub> gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Opium is analgesic, hypnotic, diaphoretic,
antispasmodic, narcotic; also cardiac and respiratory
depressant after primary brief stimulation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Doses.</span>&mdash;It dries all secretions except the
mammae and skin. The latter being increased, it produces
dryness of the mouth and throat, arrests gastric
secretions, retards digestion and causes anorexia (loss
of appetite); it stimulates the brain by increasing the
blood supply; in man it stimulates the mental activity,
while in animals it stimulates motor activity; it does not
affect the conductivity of nerves, but it prevents the
consciousness to pain by paralyzing the nerve centers;
the action of the heart is increased and arterial tension
is raised; the pupil slightly contracted; the mind at
first stimulated, becomes calm, sleep follows, disturbed
by dreams and headache; constipation and some depression
follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large Doses.</span>&mdash;Arrest digestion, cause nausea and
vomiting, greatly increase perspiration, prevents the
conductivity of nerves, depresses the heart and circulation,
impairing oxidation and lowering temperature; it
contracts the pupil by stimulating the motor nerve of the
eye (in horses it dilates the pupil) and causes intense
puritis (itching), especially of the nose, often retention
of the urine and soon profound sleep; in some cases
coma or delirium, leaving as after-effects nausea, depression,
constipation, vertigo, anorexia, nasal puritis
and fetid pathological secretions.</p>

<p><i>Morphine and codeine compared with the action of
opium.</i> Morphine is more anodyne and hypnotic; it
causes more intense puritis (itching) is less stimulant,
less convulsant, less constipating and diaphoretic.</p>

<p>Codeine is a motor paralyzant; it exalts the spinal
cord more than morphine and affects the cerebrum less,
producing muscular tremors in excess of sedation; it
reduces the urinary sugar in diabetes and has a selective
sedative influence on the pneumogastric nerve, thus a
better sedative in cough.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75"><i>Indications for the use of Opium</i>:</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">1. To relieve pain and spasm.</p>

<p>2. To produce sleep.</p>

<p>3. To abort inflammation.</p>

<p>4. To check excessive secretions.</p>

<p>5. To act as a stimulant and supporting agent.</p>

<p>6. As a sudorific (not so active in animals as in man).</p>

<p>Sulphuric ether administered with opium prevents
its drying up effects as well as the nauseating and depressing
effects. Used for pain from any cause except
acute inflammation of the brain. Used in low fevers
to support the system when sufficient food cannot be
taken, also in irritation of bronchi, bladder, stomach and
bowels, as well as the uterus.</p>

<p>In inflammation of the serous membranes which line
the abdominal walls (peritonitis) opium can be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
freely; combined or alternated with aconite and diuretics
is very highly recommended and tends to prevent
dropsical conditions.</p>

<p>In inflammation of the serous membrane investing
lungs and lining the thorax (pleurisy) opium and aconite
will often arrest its development if administered in
its first stages.</p>

<p>In diarrhoea and dysentery opium is said to be one
of the best medicines we have, it can be combined with
acetate of lead, prepared chalk, etc.</p>

<p>In inflammation of the bowels, owing to its effect
in binding up the bowels, belladonna alternated with
aconite is preferred to opium.</p>

<p>In colds administer Dover’s Powder, or opium, ammonium
carbonate, quinine sulphate and camphor.</p>

<p>In spasmodic colic do not use opium, but give hypodermically
three to four grains of morphine sulphate; it
is non-constipating; also use anodynes, such as cannabis
indica, hyoscyamus, etc., are preferable.</p>

<p>In gastritis, opium conjoined with bismuth subnitrate
and hydrastis.</p>

<p>In eversion of the rectum or uterus, administer morphine
hypodermically to prevent straining.</p>

<p>In muscular spasms opium is very effective.</p>

<p>In cerebro-spinal meningitis opium should be administered
early, before exudation has set in, with belladonna
and ergot, alternated with aconite.</p>

<p>In diabetes mellitus, codeine is said to be best, as it
lessens the amount of sugar in the urine and should be
administered by the mouth; if given hypodermically
it exerts no influence on the sugar.</p>

<p>In catarrhal diseases administer opium to lessen the
discharge.</p>

<p>In Thumps administer full doses of morphine subcutaneously.</p>

<p>In inflammation of the eyes morphine sulphate is
very efficient combined with zinc sulphate and distilled
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toxic Doses.</span>&mdash;Produce cold clammy sweat, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
slow heart, diminished quantity of urine, abolished reflexes,
coma, the pupil minutely contracted (except in
the horse) but dilated as the end approaches and death
by suspension of respiration, due to direct action of the
poison on the respiratory centers in the medulla.</p>

<p>In case of poisoning. Emetics, stomach pump,
permanganate of potassium, grain for grain of morphine,
or 10 to 15 grains dissolved in 8 ounces of water,
given by the mouth for large dogs, and 1 to 2 drachms
of permanganate of potassium in 2 or 3 pints of water
for horses. Artificial respiration, striking the body,
keep patient moving, empty bladder to prevent absorption.</p>

<h4>APOMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDUM&mdash;APOMORPHINE
HYDROCHLORIDE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The hydrochloride of an artificial alkaloid,
obtained by heating morphine or codeine in hermetically
closed tubes with an excess of pure hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Minute, grayish-white, shining monoclinic
prisms, without odor, having a faintly bitter taste
and acquiring a greenish tint upon exposure to light and
air. It should be kept in small, dark, amber-colored
vials. Soluble in water, alcohol, ether and chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;As an emetic for dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> gr., by the
mouth, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> gr., subcutaneously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;As an expectorant, subcutaneously, horses,
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> gr.; foals, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; cattle,
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; sheep and calves,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> to
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> gr. By the mouth, dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub>
to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25</sub> gr. as an expectorant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;It is a prompt and effectual
emetic in animals that vomit, acting on the vomiting centers.
When <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> gr. dissolved in water is swallowed by
either man or dog repeated vomiting occurs, but is not
followed by so much nausea as usually follows the use
of tartar emetic. Increases bronchial, intestinal and
pancreatic secretions. Chronic dry bronchitis of dogs
is benefited by apomorphine. In pica cattle, 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> gr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
may be given on three consecutive days, or in recent
cases, 3 gr. are given subcutaneously in the same way.
It relieves choking in animals by its relaxing spasm and
increasing secretion of the gullet. Three-quarters of a
grain may be injected under the skin in horses. It
should be tried before using a probang, as, if successful,
it will act within fifteen or twenty minutes. The alkaloid
decomposes in crystal and rapidly in solution, becoming
toxic and of a green hue. Solutions should be
freshly prepared.</p>

it resembles, in solubility, petrolatum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span>&mdash;All preparations of petrolatum are valuable
emollients. They soothe, protect and soften parts
to which they are applied and are superior to animal or
vegetable fats or oils in not becoming rancid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Petrolatum may be used alone, or as an excipient
in the preparation of ointments, but does not aid
the absorption of drugs (as do alcohol, glycerine, chloroform,
animal oils and fats), for it is not itself absorbed
even when administered internally. Petrolatum exerts
a demulcent action upon the mucous membrane of the
alimentary tract, and may be prescribed in electuary or
capsule in inflammation thereof. Liquid petrolatum is
useful given internally in piles (dogs one-half ounce
twice daily) to soften the feces. It is also very serviceable
with menthol and camphor (equal parts, fifteen
grains to one ounce) dropped in the nostrils (with a
medicine dropper) for dogs with acute nasal catarrh.
Petrolatum is sold universally under the proprietary
names of vaseline and cosmoline, and is often combined
with antiseptics for medical and surgical purposes in
skin diseases and upon inflamed mucous membranes,
blisters and abraded surfaces and sores. It is one of
the most useful agents in lubricating instruments, protecting
metal from rust, and is sometimes employed as a
vehicle for electuaries. It should not be used as a base
for blisters or other ointments where absorption is desired.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>UNGUENTUM PICIS LIQUIDAE&mdash;TAR OINTMENT</h4>

<p>Composed of tar, 500; yellow wax, 150; lard, 350.</p>

<p>Used alone as a healing ointment or as a base.</p>

<h4>OLEUM PICIS LIQUIDAE&mdash;OIL OF TAR</h4>

<p>A volatile oil distilled from tar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;An almost colorless liquid when freshly
distilled, but soon acquiring a dull, reddish brown
color, and having a strong tarry odor and taste. Soluble
in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 to 4 dr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Internally, is an antiseptic stimulant expectorant.
Externally, it is rubefacient and if continually
rubbed in may cause papules and pustules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Tar or the oil is commonly used in cough<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
mixtures and in subacute and chronic bronchitis. By
inhalation (which is done by pouring tar on a heated
shovel or a shovel containing live coals or by adding a
pint of tar to a gallon of water, heating the mixture by
placing hot bricks or stones in the solution) either
method is excellent for its local antiseptic and stimulating
effects in the various catarrhal diseases; bronchitis,
distemper, strangles, etc. Care should be used so that
the vapor be not inhaled too hot.</p>

<p>Externally, it is a very useful agent in various skin
diseases, both parasitic and non-parasitic; for this the
official ointment may be used, or if used on a large surface
on dogs it should be diluted with an equal amount
of zinc ointment.</p>

<h2>PLUMBI OXIDUM&mdash;LEAD OXIDE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made by roasting lead in the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A heavy, yellowish or reddish-yellow
powder, or minute scales, without odor or taste. Almost
insoluble in water; insoluble in alcohol. Lead oxide is
only valuable for its preparations.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>PLUMBI ACETAS&mdash;LEAD ACETATE&mdash;SUGAR
OF LEAD</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Heat lead oxide in acetic acid and
water. Lead acetate crystallizes on cooling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, shining, transparent; monoclinic
prisms or plates, or heavy, white crystalline masses,
or granular crystals, having a faintly acetous odor and
a sweetish, astringent, afterwards metallic taste. Efflorescent
and absorbing carbon dioxide on exposure to
the air. Soluble in two parts of water and in thirty
parts of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 15 to 20 gr.; dogs, 1 to 2 gr. Given in capsule or
solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span></p>

<h4>LIQUOR PLUMBI SUBACETATIS&mdash;SOLUTION
OF LEAD SUBACETATE&mdash;GOULARD’S
EXTRACT</h4>

<p>An aqueous liquid, containing in solution about 25
per cent of lead subacetate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made from acetate of lead, 180 parts;
oxide of lead, 110 parts; boiled together in water to
make 1000 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A dense, clear colorless liquid, sweet,
astringent taste, decomposed by exposure to the air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;The lead compounds are powerful astringents,
haemostatics, styptics, anodynes, local sedatives
and desiccants; they coagulate albumen and form
a protective coat, also contract small vessels. In large
or continued doses they irritate, then paralyze voluntary
and involuntary muscles, and also the central nervous
system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Plumbi acetate is administered internally to
check haemorrhages, especially of the stomach and
lungs, has been used in purpura in horses with varying
results; it is said to be very good in red water of cattle;
also used in diabetes insipidus; for diarrhoea, lead acetate
with opium is very good, also in dysentery, chronic
scouring and bronchorrhoea; it is occasionally prescribed
as a gargle.</p>

<p>Externally used in solution to check superficial inflammation;
used on burns, bruises and ulcers, also to
cool and relieve strained and inflamed tendons and
joints, it is also used as a wash to abate the itching of
nettle-rash and erythema and other skin diseases; also
serviceable in eczema and grease-heel; used in eye wash
but should not be used when there is an abrasion of the
cornea, as insoluble compounds are formed; the acetate
may be used as an ointment or powder or in solution dissolved
in twenty to forty parts water, a little vinegar or
acetic acid increases its solubility; it is used in white
lotion combined with zinc sulphate and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>Goulard’s Extract, four ounces to a pint of water,
is used for sprains, bruises, cuts, burns, scratches, grease-heel,
etc. For painful affections, tincture of opium,
four to six ounces to one pint, or belladonna, two ounces
to the pint, are added. Goulard’s Extract, one part,
lard oil, four parts, makes a good dressing for blistered
or bruised surfaces, grease-heel and other ailments of
that class; for skin diseases, eczema, canker of ear in
dog, etc.</p>

<h2>POTASSII ACETAS&mdash;POTASSIUM ACETATE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Add acetic acid in excess to potassium
carbonate. Evaporate to dryness and fuse residue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White, deliquescent, satiny, neutral
masses of a peculiar odor; also in a granular form. Soluble
in water and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr.</p>

<h3>POTASSII CITRAS&mdash;POTASSIUM CITRATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Neutralize potassium carbonate with
a solution of citric acid and evaporate to dryness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White, granular, deliquescent powder,
saline taste, neutral reaction. Soluble in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as potassium acetate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Potassium acetate and citrate are the
least irritant to the stomach of all the potassium salts.
They are neutral and have no action on the gastric juice:
are not antacid. They are changed into the carbonate
of potassium and as such circulate in the blood. Are
powerful direct diuretics, stimulate the renal cells direct
and increase both the water and the solids of the urine,
also diaphoretic; the citrate more than the acetate. They
have a slight depressing action on the heart, and slightly
expectorant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Potassium acetate and citrate are indicated
in irritation or inflammation of the kidneys and bladder
and cause absorption of exudations (pleural effusion, for
example) through their diuretic power. They are sometimes
prescribed in fever on account of slight diaphoretic<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
and powerful diuretic properties. They also stimulate
bronchial secretions and make it thinner and are
recommended accordingly in bronchitis. They are used
in gouty conditions, Bright’s disease, fevers of all kinds,
azoturia, dropsical conditions, pleurisy, ascites oedema
of the legs, sheath, udder, etc., combined with tonics,
as iron, etc.</p>

<h3>POTASSII BROMIDUM&mdash;POTASSIUM BROMIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Potassium bromide may be obtained
by adding a slight excess of bromide to a strong solution
of potassium hydroxide, evaporating the potassium
bromide and bromate to dryness, decomposing the bromate
by fusing the mixture with charcoal and purifying
the crystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, or white, cubical crystals, or
granules; odorless and having a strong saline taste.
Permanent in the air. Soluble in about fifteen parts of
water and in about one hundred and eighty parts of alcohol.</p>

<h3>SODII BROMIDUM&mdash;SODIUM BROMIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Sodium bromide may be obtained in
the same manner as potassium bromide, sodium hydroxide
being used in place of potassium hydroxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;It occurs in colorless or white, cubical
crystals, or a white, granular powder, odorless and having
a saline, bitter taste. The salt absorbs moisture
from the air without deliquescing. Soluble in one and
seven-tenths parts of water and in twelve and a half
parts of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action of Potassium and Sodium Bromide.</span>&mdash;They
are distinguished depressants of the cerebral and
spinal functions, also hypnotic, anaphrodisiac, antispasmodic
and alterative. The bromide of potash, like all
other potassium salts, is especially a cardiac and muscular
paralyzant. They are very diffusible and slowly
eliminated; long continued doses produce gastric catarrh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
They reduce the number of respirations and the
heart’s action and force; lessen activity of brain cells,
producing sleep; diminish sensibility of peripheral
nerves, causing anesthesia of the skin and mucous membrane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;The bromides, being particularly useful in
the treatment of functional nervous diseases, do
not possess nearly the value in veterinary medicine that
they have in human practice. Consequently their use
is limited mainly to canine disorders, as bromides have
little influence upon diseases of horses. They are sometimes
used as sedatives to the nervous system, to lower
reflex activity, to produce sleep, to subdue excitement
of the genital apparatus and to antagonize congestion
of the brain. Used extensively in fits of dogs, twenty
or thirty grain doses of the bromide of potash or bromide
of soda dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; may
be used per rectum if necessary in any convulsive or
spasmodic condition. In strychnine poisoning, the bromide
of potash may be used as an antidote in place of
chloral hydrate or conjoined with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 5 to 60 gr.; average dose, 20 gr.</p>

<h3>POTASSII CARBONAS&mdash;POTASSIUM CARBONATE&mdash;SALTS
OF TARTAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;The solution resulting from the lixiviation
of wood ashes is boiled to dryness and the resultant
mass is the potash of commerce. This is purified to
some extent by burning in ovens, forming pearlash, a
mixture of the hydrate and carbonate. Water dissolves
mainly the carbonate which is obtained by evaporation
of the aqueous solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, granular powder, odorless
and having a strongly alkaline taste; very deliquescent.
Soluble in water; insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span></p>

<h3>POTASSII BICARBONAS&mdash;POTASSIUM
BICARBONATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Potassium bicarbonate is obtained by
saturating a strong aqueous solution of potassium carbonate
and carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent, monoclinic
prisms, odorless and having a saline and slightly alkaline
taste. Permanent in the air. Soluble in water. Almost
soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as potassium carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;They stimulate the production
of gastric juice when administered before meals with
bitter tonics, or after meals to overcome excessive acidity
of the stomach; used in rheumatism and gouty condition
to make blood alkaline and overcome lactic acid. Useful
as an antacid in nettle-rash and other itching skin
diseases. Internally and externally as a mild wash, two
to four drachms to the pint. A solution of the same
strength is injected to overcome acidity of the uterus in
leucorrhoea, etc. Calculus made up of ammonium,
magnesium and phosphates occur in the bladder and
urethra of highly fed rams and wethers. For this use
potassium bicarbonate one-half to one drachm, well diluted,
conjoined with laxative diet and belladonna to
dilate urethra; it is less certain as a diuretic than the
acetate or nitrate of potassium.</p>

<h3>POTASSII HYDROXIDUM&mdash;POTASSIUM
HYDROXIDE&mdash;CAUSTIC POTASH</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A solution hydrate is evaporated, and
this is fused and run into moulds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;White, translucent pencils or fused
masses, hard and brittle, showing a crystalline fracture;
odorless or having a faint odor of lye and a very acid and
caustic taste. Very deliquescent in air. Soluble in water
and alcohol.</p>

<p>Not used in this form to any extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span></p>

<h3>LIQUOR POTASSII HYDROXIDI&mdash;SOLUTION
OF POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE</h3>

<p>A solution of potassium hydroxide (caustic potash)
containing about five per cent of the hydroxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Boiling a solution of potassium carbonate
with calcium hydrate leaves potassium hydrate in
solution, while calcium carbonate is precipitated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clean, clear colored liquid, odorless,
having a very acrid and caustic taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 10 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Externally potassium hydroxide
and the solution of potassium hydroxide are irritant
and caustic, when applied they abstract water from the
parts. They dissolve fatty matters, antacids and if well
diluted acts as a sedative. Internally not used to any
extent, as milder salts of potassium are preferred, is
antacid, alterative, febrifuge and diuretic. Large undiluted
doses corrode and inflame the alimentary tract,
cause colicy pains, great depression and sometimes perforations.
Caustic potash is sometimes used to destroy
warts and fungous growths. A dilute solution is used
to cauterize poisoned wounds, but is dangerous, as it
may penetrate too deeply and spread. This can be
overcome by washing with vinegar.</p>

<h3>POTASSII IODIDUM&mdash;POTASSIUM IODIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Potassium iodide may be prepared in
the same manner as potassium bromide iodine, being
used in place of bromine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;It is a colorless, transparent, translucent,
or opaque white, cubical crystals, or white granular
powder, having a peculiar, faint, iodine-like odor and a
pungent, saline, afterwards bitter, taste. Permanent in
dry air and but slightly deliquescent in moist air. Soluble
in 0.7 parts of water, and in about 12 parts of alcohol
at 77° F., in 0.5 parts of boiling water, in 6 parts of
boiling alcohol; also soluble in 2.5 parts of glycerine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Potassium iodide closely resembles iodine<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
but is less powerful and devoid of local irritant action.
Medical doses are antiseptic, desquamatic, deobstruent,
expectorant, alterative and diuretic. It stimulates the
lymphatic system. It is readily soluble, and is quickly
absorbed in the tissues, where it undergoes decomposition;
the iodine, when liberated, apparently combines
with albuminoids and acts specially on the lymphatic
glands and vessels, modifying nutrition, hastening metabolism
and promoting absorption. It is doubtless in
this way that it also unites with lead and mercury deposited
in the tissues, renders them soluble, carries them
into the circulation and causes their elimination.</p>

<p>It is quickly excreted by the mucus and skin surfaces,
but chiefly by the kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Potassium iodide is useful in promoting absorption
of enlarged lymphatic glands, and its action
should be assisted by the application of iodine or red
iodide of mercury externally. Potassium iodide in
small doses diminishes congestion and increases the fluidity
and amount of secretions in acute laryngitis, acute
and subacute bronchitis, and appears to possess an alterative
action in improving the condition and nutrition
of the bronchial mucous membranes. It is also of
some value in asthma, pulmonary emphysema and
chronic bronchitis, unassociated with copious secretion.
Chronic pleuritis, pericarditis and ascites are treated
with potassium iodide, which assists absorption and occasionally
exerts a diuretic effect. Tardy resolution of
pneumonia consolidation is hastened by potassium iodide.
Endocarditis with cardiac hypertrophy is said
to be benefited by potassium iodide and digitalis.</p>

<p>Champignon, or scirrhous cord in horses, is sometimes
cured by the sorbefacient powers of potassium iodide in
full doses. Potassium iodide is of value in goiter of dogs,
calves and sheep when tincture of iodine is used externally.
“Roaring” and “thick wind” may be cured by
the administration of potassium iodide. It is the best
medicine known for actinomycosis. Potassium iodide has
a clinical reputation for its power to aid absorption and<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
resolution in inflammation or effusions of the brain or
spinal cord, in paralysis of the body or limbs and inflammation
of the membranes covering the brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 to 4 dr.; cattle, 3 to 6 dr.; sheep
and pigs, 15 to 30 gr.; dogs, 1 to 10 gr.</p>

<p>It should be given to the larger animals in doses of
three drachms daily, until iodism appears, which shows
itself by loss of appetite, an irritable, catarrhal condition
of the mucous membranes of the nostrils, eyes, throat
and digestive organs, a vesicular skin eruption, abstinence
from water, diminished secretions of urine, temperature
elevated and emaciation.</p>

<h3>POTASSII NITRAS&mdash;POTASSIUM NITRATE&mdash;NITRATE
OF POTASH&mdash;NITER&mdash;SALTPETRE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Nitrate of potash may be obtained
by purifying crude niter, or by the interaction of sodium
nitrate and potassium chloride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent, six-sided,
rhombic prisms, or a crystalline powder, odorless and
having a cooling, saline and pungent taste. Permanent
in the air. Soluble in water; very sparingly soluble in
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 to 6 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Large doses irritate the stomach, bowels
and kidneys; medical doses are alterative, febrifuge, diuretic
and feebly laxative. Excreted by the bronchial
glands, skin and kidneys, increasing secretions of these
organs; is a cardiac depressant and mild refrigerant and
diaphoretic.</p>

<p>Nitrate of potash is more frequently prescribed than
any other potash salt in veterinary medicine, and is commonly
considered one of the best febrifuges. Its only
service in fevers is as a diuretic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;In certain febrile conditions; in oedema of
legs should be combined with digitalis and general tonics.
For dropsical conditions the acetate and citrate are
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span></p>

<p>Nitrate of potash is highly recommended in acute
laminitis, two to four ounces once or twice daily is given
by some veterinarians.</p>

<h3>POTASSII CHLORAS&mdash;POTASSIUM
CHLORATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Pass chlorine into a mixture of potassium
carbonate and calcium hydrate; dissolve the result
in boiling water and recover the chlorate by crystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, lustrous, monoclinic prisms
or plates, or white powder, odorless, having a cooling,
saline taste. Permanent in the air. Soluble in water.
Insoluble in absolute alcohol, but slightly soluble in mixtures
of alcohol and water. Explodes readily when
rubbed with sugar, sulphur, charcoal, glycerine and
many other substances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 6 dr.; sheep and pigs,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span>&mdash;Chlorate of potash is antiseptic, antacid,
alterative, sialagogue, diuretic, febrifuge, and cardiac
depressant; irritant to the gastro-intestinal tract and
kidneys. Externally, antiseptic, mild stimulant and refrigerant.
Is a protoplasmic poison, as is the nitrate;
disintegrates the red blood corpuscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Chlorate of potash is valuable as a wash or
gargle, it stimulates the salivary and buccal glands,
moistening the dry, parched mouth. It soothes and
heals aphthous eruptions and ulcerations of the mouth
and throat; while in catarrh, sore throat and bronchitis
it thins the secretions and promotes expectoration. Like
other salines, in febrile and inflammatory diseases,
whether in horses or cattle, it is believed to lower pulse
and temperature, clean the tongue, improve appetite,
gently stimulate the bowels and render the evacuations
more natural and less coated with mucus. It is frequently
prescribed with good results in horses suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
from catarrhal conditions of the bowels. In epizootic
catarrh, purpura, it is very beneficial prescribed
with iron salts, as it increases the coagulability of the
blood. It is also prescribed with other salines, bitter
tonics or stimulants. Most animals of their own accord
will take an ounce daily, dissolved in their drinking
water or gruel. Pine tar is a soothing electuary for
sore throat, it is conjoined with camphor, belladonna and
treacle.</p>

<h3>POTASSII BITARTRAS&mdash;POTASSIUM BITARTRATE&mdash;CREAM
OF TARTAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained from crude tartar deposited
on the sides of wine casks during fermentation of grape
juice, by purification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless or slightly opaque, rhombic
crystals, or a white, somewhat gritty powder; odorless
and having a pleasant, acidulous taste. Permanent in
the air. Soluble in water; very sparingly soluble in
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Potassium bitartrate is a non-irritating
purgative in large doses. It is a hydragogue cathartic
and has a strong affinity for water; abstracting it from
the blood vessels in the bowels, holding the same in solution
and thus flushing out the intestines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Is used for liver disease, chronic constipation,
skin disease and as a refrigerant in febrile conditions.
It should be given in solution and is useful in dropsies,
more particularly of renal origin; also in catarrhal jaundice,
and as a laxative for foals and calves. In cases
where the urine of the horse is thick, stringy and high
colored, it will cause it to regain its normal state. It
may easily be administered in either food or drinking
water, and its diuretic effect is enhanced when given
with a large amount of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span></p>

<h3>POTASSII PERMANGANAS&mdash;POTASSIUM
PERMANGANATE&mdash;PERMANGANATE
OF POTASH</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Potassium permanganate may be obtained
by the interaction of potassium chlorate, potassium hydroxide
and manganese dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Potassium permanganate is a powerful
oxidizing agent and readily yields up its oxygen in the
form of ozone; hence it is an antiseptic and deodorizer.
Full strength it is a mild caustic. Diluted it is astringent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Potassium permanganate is advantageously
used to deodorize and disinfect foul smelling wounds,
the nostrils in eczema, nasal gleet, the mouth in aphthae,
throat when ulcerated, diphtheria, the uterus in metritis,
retention of placenta and leucorrhoea. It is sometimes
given internally in puerperal, erysipelas and septicaemia,
also to cleanse hands or instruments. Potassium permanganate
is used as a prophylactic in solutions of one
in five thousand in poultry.</p>

<p>Potassium permanganate acts as an oxidizant much
more freely upon some organic substances than upon
others, by virtue of which fact it is a valuable antidote,
notably in the treatment of morphine-poisoning and of
snake-poisoning. In the former condition it acts only
upon the alkaloid in the stomach, but should be given
frequently during the continuance of the symptoms in
order to destroy any morphine which may have been
eliminated from the blood into the stomach. In snake-poisoning
a concentrated solution of it should be injected
freely and immediately into the part which has
been bitten. Potassium permanganate is one of the
best medicines with which to sterilize the hands before
operating. A saturated solution is used for this purpose
and the stains may be removed from the hands by
washing them in saturated solution of oxalic acid, or
in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 15 gr. to 1 dr. in one pint
of water; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 gr. in half pint of water;<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
dogs and cats, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 11 gr. in capsule with kaolin.
For poultry it should be diluted one part to five thousand
parts of water.</p>

<p>As an antiseptic and deodorizer for disinfecting
newly cut or old foul smelling wounds and for surgical
purposes one drachm to half an ounce of the drug to one
pint of water.</p>

<p>As an eye wash use about one in two thousand to one
in one thousand.</p>

<p>For uterine injections use one in five thousand to
one in two thousand.</p>

<p>As an antidote for opium, morphine or weed-poisoning
it can be administered by the mouth or hypodermically.
When given for these purposes the amount of potassium
permanganate should equal that of the poison
taken.</p>

tonic. It resembles gentian and calumba. It is prescribed
for the several domestic animals in dyspepsia,
loss of appetite and convalescence from debilitating disorders.
Qussia is the most efficient vermicide in our
possession for the destruction of Oxyuris curvula, horse;
and O. vermicularis, dog, in the lower bowel. An infusion
is employed for this purpose, made by soaking
qussia chips in cold water (two drachms of the qussia
to one pint of water) for half an hour. The rectum
should be first thoroughly washed out with soap and
water and one-half pint of this infusion is given in
enema to dogs; two quarts to horses. The infusion is
a narcotic poison for flies and other insects.</p>

constitutes Sinapis.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>OLEUM SINAPIS VOLATILE&mdash;VOLATILE
OIL OF MUSTARD</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;A volatile oil obtained from black
mustard by maceration with water and subsequent distillation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless or pale yellow, and
strongly refractive liquid, having a very pungent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
acrid odor and taste. Freely soluble in alcohol, ether
or carbon disulphide, the solution being neutral to litmus
paper. Specific gravity 1.013 to 1.020.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Is irritant or counter-irritant, rubefacient,
vesicant or suppurant, according to the manner
in which it is used; it acts much quicker than cantharides,
but its action is not so prolonged; the paste made
with water and rubbed into the skin of horses, produces
its effects within twenty minutes; in two to six hours
vesication occurs, pustules may occur where the paste is
used very strong or closely repeated, or too much has
been used.</p>

<p>The volatile oil of mustard is a very powerful vesicant
and acts very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is used as a counter-irritant in laryngitis,
pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy, or
wherever a counter-irritant is indicated; applied in the
early congested stages it lessens the pain and relieves
difficult breathing, besides reflexly limiting the amount
of blood in the parts; it thus limits or decreases the inflammatory
action; also useful in the exudative stages
of these diseases; to promote the absorption of the exudate
and thus hasten resolution, or where these diseases
remain dormant; also arouse a depressed nervous system
and reflexly stimulates the heart; can be used in spinal
diseases or in congestion of the kidneys.</p>

<p>It acts best when applied and left on 20 or 30 minutes,
then washed off and repeat in an hour or two;
also used in acute indigestion, applied to the abdomen;
also in colic, enteritis and peritonitis; in phlebitis mustard
can be used, but a cantharides blister is better. In making
a mustard plaster, take the pure powdered mustard
and gradually pour in warm water (not hot); can also
be made with cold water or vinegar; rub in with moderate
friction.</p>

<p>As an emetic for dogs one to two teaspoonfuls in
one or two ounces of warm water is very effective.</p>

<h2>SODIUM BICARBONATE&mdash;BICARBONATE OF
SODA</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Bicarbonate of soda may be obtained by
exposing crystals of sodium carbonate to carbonic anhydride,
or by the interaction of sodium chloride and ammonium
bicarbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Bicarbonate of soda is a white, opaque
powder, odorless and having a cooling, mildly alkaline
taste. It is permanent in dry, but slowly decomposes
in moist air. Soluble in twelve parts of water at 15° C.
(59° F.); above this temperature the solution gradually
loses carbon dioxide, and at boiling heat the salt
is entirely converted into normal carbonate, insoluble in
alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Antacid, peristaltic stimulant, carminative,
alterative and mildly anodyne externally. It also
increases fluidity of and secretion of gastric juice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;In disorders of the digestive organ administered
half hour before meals, to increase the flow of
gastric juice, or as an antacid after meals. Young
calves when fed on stale skim milk, suffering from dyspepsia,
are benefited by one to two drams of bicarbonate
of soda, dissolved in each meal of milk. Bicarbonate of
soda has become a very popular medicine in the treatment
of azoturia in about four ounce doses every four
hours. Bicarbonate of soda is used to lessen the irritation
of itching skin disorders, as nettle-rash and urticaria,
one ounce to a quart of water. Also used as an
injection for leucorrhoea. It is an antidote for acid
poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 dr. to 4 oz.; cattle, 2 dr. to 2 oz.;
sheep and pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 10 to 30 gr.</p>

<h2>SODII CHLORIDUM&mdash;SODIUM CHLORIDE&mdash;COMMON
OR TABLE SALT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Mined in a native state and obtained by
evaporation of brine, spring or sea water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;It is officially described as in “colorless,
transparent, cubical crystals, or a white, crystalline<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
powder, odorless and heavy, a purely saline taste.” Permanent
in dry air. Soluble in two and eight-tenths
parts of water at 25° C. (77° F.), and in two and a
half parts of boiling water; almost insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Sodium chloride in small doses is a condiment,
restorative, tonic, stomachic, antiferment, alterative,
laxative, anthelmintic antiseptic emetic for dogs
and used as an injection for pin worms.</p>

<p>Animals deprived of salt do not thrive as it is an
essential constituent of food necessary to the composition
of HCl in the gastric juice, and of blood plasma,
from which it is constantly eliminated in the urine. As
an emetic for dogs one to four drams of salt, and one
dram of powdered mustard dissolved in four ounces of
tepid water. Common salt as an eye-wash is a tonic to
the eyes; one dram to a pint of water. Feed animals
refined salt, as rocksalt contains irritating properties
due to its great impurity. A cooling and stimulating
lotion for sprains and bruises may be made by dissolving
two ounces of common salt, nitrate of potash and chloride
of ammonia in a quart of water.</p>

<p>Use pure cooking salt in <i>normal salt solution</i>, which
contains six of one per cent (about fifty grains to a
pint), or may be made at once by adding a heaping teaspoonful
of pure salt into a quart of sterilized water at
a temperature of 100° to 110° F. In cases of azoturia
give plenty of salt; it acts as a diuretic, makes the horse
thirsty and causes him to drink water freely and flushes
the kidneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horse, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 oz.; cattle, 2 to 3 oz.; sheep,
2 to 4 dr.; pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr. These
doses are stomachic alterative; when used for cattle as a
cathartic and vermifuge give 10 to 20 ounces in water,
usually combined with magnesium or sodium sulphate.</p>

<h2>SODII SULPHAS&mdash;SODIUM SULPHATE&mdash;GLAUBER’S
SALTS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Sodium sulphate effloresces on the soil in
various parts of Europe. It also exists in solution in
many mineral springs in the United States. Sodium<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
sulphate is also produced artificially in several chemical
operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Sodium sulphate is in large, colorless,
transparent, monoclinic prisms, or granular crystals;
odorless, and having a bitter, saline taste. It effloresces
rapidly in the air, and finally loses all its water of
crystalization. Soluble in three parts of water at the
temperature of 59° F., insoluble in alcohol, soluble in
glycerine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Saline cathartic, cholagogue, hepatic
stimulant, slightly diuretic and febrifuge. When the
effects of a hepatic stimulant is required it should be
given in small repeated doses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is advantageously used as a cathartic in
congestion of the liver, in small repeated doses, also useful
in dropsical conditions, influenza, especially where
the liver is involved; tetanus and febrile diseases, where
the bowels are apt to be constipated. Give two to four
ounces in a bucket of water. It is successfully used in
itching skin diseases in full doses combined with bicarbonate
of soda two to four ounces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;As a cathartic, well diluted in water at
about 59° F.; horses, 16 to 24 ounces; cattle, 1 to 2
pounds; sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 ounces. Where repetition
is necessary the dose should be reduced one-eighth
of the above. Best results are obtained when administered
with capsicum or ginger, as it prevents griping
and assists its action.</p>

<h2>SODII THIOSULPHAS&mdash;SODIUM THIOSULPHATE&mdash;SODIUM
HYPOSULPHITE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Sodium hyposulphite is prepared by dissolving
sulphur in boiling aqueous solution of sodium
sulphite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent, monoclinic
prisms; odorless and having a cooling, afterwards bitter
taste. Permanent in air 91.4° F., but efflorescent in
dry air above that temperature; slightly deliquescent in
moist air. Soluble in about 0.35 parts of water at 77°<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
F. At boiling heat the solution is rapidly decomposed;
insoluble in alcohol, slightly soluble in turpentine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Sodium hyposulphite is an antiseptic,
deodoriser and insecticide. In the presence of acids,
without and also within the body, it gives off sulphurous
acid, which it therefore resembles. It is thought to
destroy ferments and bacteria, and removes offensive
smells. Its properties are greatly increased when used
along with the tar acids. When standing long in contact
with water the sulphite decomposes and gives off
hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Sodium hyposulphite is recommended in indigestion,
fermentation, flatulence and foul smelling
feces and in general septic conditions, but have proven as
useless as most other medicines in their latter stages.
It is used externally in parasitic affections of the skin
and mouth in the form of an ointment or solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doses.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ozs.; sheep
and pigs, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 30 gr.</p>

<h2>SPIRITUS AETHERIS NITROSI&mdash;SPIRIT OF
NITROUS ETHER&mdash;SWEET SPIRITS
OF NITER</h2>

<p>An alcoholic solution of ethyl nitrate, yielding when
freshly prepared not less than four per cent of ethyl
nitrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivative.</span>&mdash;Mix sulphuric acid (40 c. c.) with water
(120 c. c.), cool and add alcohol and water each, (85
c. c.) and place in (1000 c. c.) flask surrounded by ice
and water. Dissolve sodium nitrate (100 gm.) in water
(285 c. c.), filter and allow filtrate to drop slowly into
the flask above. Wash ethyl nitrate formed with sodium
carbonate solution, to remove acid, and agitate
with potassium carbonate, to remove water. Add ethyl-nitrate
to 22 times its weight of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clear, mobile, volatile, inflammable
liquid, of a pale-yellowish or faintly greenish-yellow tint,
having a fragrant ethereal and pungent odor, free from
acidity, and a sharp burning taste. Mixes freely with
water and alcohol.</p>

as a rule every two, three or four hours, usually combined
with other medicines for all of its purposes, in
fever and colic cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Spirit of nitrous ether conjoins the action
of the alcohol and ethyl nitrite of which it consists.
It is hence a general stimulant and a relaxer and paralyzer
of non-striped muscle. It relieves acute fever and
the difficult breathing of bronchitis and asthma. It is
antispasmodic, diaphoretic and diuretic. Large doses
are narcotic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Consisting of strong spirit and a saline ether,
when swallowed it stimulates the stomach and intestines;
is hence stomachic, carminative and antispasmodic,
and is prescribed to animals in indigestion, tympanites,
colic and convalescence from debilitating disorders.
But its properties as a diffusible nitrite, relaxing spasm
of involuntary muscles, also come into operation. It
dilates arterioles, thus decreases arterial tension, and
hence is of special value in the acute stages of fever,
whether depending upon specific conditions or local inflammation.
It relaxes the muscular fibers of the bronchial
tubes, and thus relieves the spasmodic contraction
and difficulty of breathing, which characterise catarrh,
bronchitis and some forms of asthma. It is specially
indicated when the heart action is weak and there is
difficulty of breathing&mdash;conditions frequently concurring
in influenza of horses. During excretion, notably
by the skin and kidneys, its twofold constitution is further
useful as the alcohol stimulates secretion, while the
ethyl nitrate dilates the lumen of contracted vessels,
and thus diaphoresis and diuresis are promoted in fevers,
local inflammations, rheumatism and other disorders.
As it is readily decomposed, even by water, it should
be diluted or mixed with other medicines or water only<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
immediately before it is administered. It is usually
given in cold water, beer or linseed tea.</p>

<h2>SPIRITUS GLYCERYLIS NITRATIS&mdash;SPIRIT
OF GLYCERYL TRINITRATE&mdash;SPIRIT
OF GLONOIN</h2>

<p>An alcoholic solution containing one per cent, by
weight, of nitroglycerine. It is probably decomposed
in the formation of potassium and sodium nitrite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Nitroglycerine is prepared by dropping
pure glycerine upon a mixture of sulphuric and
nitric acids, kept cool by ice, and purified by washing
with water. The official one per cent solution is not
explosive unless it becomes concentrated by evaporation
to an extent exceeding ten per cent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clear, colorless liquid, possessing
the odor and taste of alcohol. Caution should be exercised
in tasting it, since even a small quantity is liable
to produce violent headache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 5 to 20 m.; dogs, 1 to 2 m. It is administered
hypodermically, intravenously, intracheally or by the
mouth according to the emergency of the case. For
hypodermic injections one-half drachm is usually sufficient
and should be diluted with one or two parts of
water. It may be repeated in 15 or 20 minutes if necessary,
then every hour or two if required. Care should
be exercised not to repeat oftener than is necessary, or
to give too large a dose as violent headache is produced
by the drug in animals as well as in man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Are the same as amyl nitrite, but more
prolonged.</p>

<p>Spirit of nitroglycerine is the most prompt and powerful
of all heart stimulants, showing its effects usually
within three to five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;It is best used in the official solution, but
for dogs may be carried in tablets or pills containing
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of a grain of glonoin. The spirit, however is
more dependable. It is a good plan in cases of cardiac<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
weakness to brace up the heart with Spirit of Glonoin,
then maintain the effect with Tincture Strophanthus.</p>

<h2>SULPHUR SUBLIMATUM&mdash;SUBLIMED SULPHUR&mdash;FLOWERS
OF SULPHUR</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained from native sulphur by
sublimation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A fine, yellow powder, having a
slightly characteristic odor and a faintly acid taste. Insoluble
in water; slightly soluble in absolute alcohol;
more readily soluble in benzine, benzol, oil of turpentine
and many other oils; also in ether, chloroform and in
boiling aqueous solutions of alkaline hydrates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 oz.; sheep and pigs,
1 to 2 oz.; dogs, 1 to 4 dr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>SULPHUR LOTUM&mdash;WASHED SULPHUR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained from sublimed sulphur,
which is treated with diluted ammonia water to wash out
sulphurous and sulphuric and ether impurities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A fine, yellow powder, without odor
or taste. Solubility same as sublimed sulphur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as sublimed sulphur.</p>

<h4>SULPHUR PRECIPITATUM&mdash;PRECIPITATED
SULPHUR</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Obtained from a solution of sublimed
sulphur, 100; in boiling calcium hydrate, 50; by precipitation
with hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A fine, amorphous powder, of a pale
yellow color, without odor or taste. Solubility same as
sublimed sulphur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as sublimed sulphur.</p>

<h4>UNGUENTUM SULPHURIS&mdash;SULPHUR
OINTMENT</h4>

<p>Composed of washed sulphur, 150; benzoinated
lard, 850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Sulphur applied to skin or mucous surfaces
is a feeble, mechanical stimulant, and hence relieves<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
chronic passive congestion. It destroys parasitic
infestation of the skin. Administered internally it is a
laxative and alterative. It destroys fungi on vines and
kills similar parasites affecting plants and animals.
How much of this toxic effect depends on the sulphur
acting as sulphur, and how much on the alkaline sulphides,
sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphurous acid into
which it is gradually converted, has not been determined.
Sulphur when swallowed is slowly acted upon by the
alkaline secretions of the intestines, and small quantities
are converted into sulphides, which stimulate the intestinal
mucous membrane. A further change liberates
sulphuretted hydrogen, which imparts its disagreeable
smell to the breath, secretions of the skin and bowels.
The greater part of the sulphur swallowed is removed
unchanged by the bowels, but a portion is excreted in the
urine as sulphates. Over-doses given to horses and
other animals cause colic, purging, prostration and sometime
fatal gastro-enteritis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;Sulphur is given to the several domestic animals
as a laxative where more powerful purgatives
might irritate&mdash;as in pregnancy, convalescence from
acute diseases in young animals, and in piles.</p>

<p>Its alterative and stimulant effects on the skin have
led to its use in rheumatism, eczema and cutaneous diseases.
Some veterinarians affirm that it benefits dry
congested conditions of the respiratory membrane by
stimulating its epithelial cells and increasing movements
of the cilia. It has no special vermicide action. Sulphur
dusted on the skin slightly stimulates, but when
dissolved by admixture with an alkali or oil, and smartly
rubbed in, it more actively stimulates the cells of the
rete Malpighi and thus hastens desquamation; while it
also increases contractility of the muscular textures, and
hence overcomes passive cutaneous hyperaemia. It thus
promotes a healthier action in chronic eczema and
psoriasis, and in such cases sulphur dressings are used
with benefit combined or alternated with iodine or tar
acids, and are aided by the internal use of sulphur and<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
arsenic. Infriction of sulphur ointment is stated to relieve
the pain of rheumatic muscles and joints. Sulphurous
gas from burning sulphur is used for husk or
hoose of sheep and calves; this is a disease in which
worms affect the bronchial tubes, due to strongylus
micrurus in calves and strongylus filaria in sheep. The
patients are placed in a loose box and sulphur is burned
about six feet away from them, so that air may dilute
the fumes before being inhaled by the animals; let them
inhale the fumes for ten or twenty minutes or longer,
unless irritation is too great.</p>

<h2>TARAXACUM&mdash;DANDELION ROOT</h2>

<p>The fresh and dried roots of Taraxacum officinale,
collected in the autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;United States and Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;The root is about six to twelve inches
long, half an inch to an inch thick, is dark brown externally
and white within. It breaks with a short fracture;
from the fractured surface a milky juice exudes,
which is inodorous, but has a bitter taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constituents.</span>&mdash;Taraxacin, a bitter, soluble, crystalline
substance; inulin, taraxacerin, resin causing milky
juice, asparagin of no medical value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs,
2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 1 to 2 dr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTUM TARAXACI&mdash;EXTRACT OF
TARAXACUM</h4>

<p>Made by percolation of powdered taraxacum with
alcohol and water, and evaporation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 4 dr.; sheep and pigs,
30 gr. to 1 dr.; dogs, 5 to 20 gr.</p>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM TARAXACI&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF TARAXACUM</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with dilute alcohol,
and evaporation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and
pigs, 2 to 4 dr.; dogs, 1 to 2 dr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Taraxacum is a simple stomachic
and bitter and may be employed in place of gentian
or calumba. It has been generally taught that
taraxacum is a hepatic stimulant and increases the secretion
of bile. This has been proven valueless. The
extract is often used as a base in preparing masses.</p>

<h2>ZINGIBER&mdash;GINGER</h2>

<p>The scraped and dried rhizome of Zingiber officinale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span>&mdash;East and West Indies and India; cultivated
in tropical climates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Ginger owes its taste to a pungent
resin, its aroma to a volatile oil, and its medicinal and
flavoring properties to both constituents, which are
chiefly found in the delicate felted layer lying between
the starchy, mealy parenchyma and the brown, horny,
external covering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 2 dr. to 1 oz.; cattle, 1 to 4 oz.; sheep
and pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 5 to 15 gr.</p>

<h3>PREPARATIONS</h3>

<h4>FLUIDEXTRACTUM ZINGIBERIS&mdash;FLUIDEXTRACT
OF GINGER</h4>

<p>Made by maceration and percolation with alcohol,
and evaporated so that 1 c. c. equals 1 gm. of the crude
drug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as for ginger.</p>

<h4>TINCTURE ZINGIBERIS&mdash;TINCTURE OF
GINGER</h4>

<p>Made by percolation of ginger with alcohol and
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 2 oz.; cattle, 1 to 4 oz.; sheep,
2 dr. to 1 oz.; pigs, 1 to 2 dr.; dogs, 15 to 30 m.</p>

<h4>OLEORESINA ZINGIBERIS&mdash;OLEORESIN OF
GINGER</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses, 30 m. to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> dr.; dogs, 1 to 5 m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Ginger is an aromatic stimulant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
and is used as a stomachic and carminative for all
animals, notably for cattle and sheep. Ginger is administered
internally, promotes gastric secretion, digestion
and appetite. It is prescribed in atonic dyspepsia,
often along with antacids and laxatives. Conjoined
with purgatives it diminishes their tendency to nauseate
and gripe, and also somewhat hastens their effects. The
powder or fluidextract should be added to magnesium
and sodium sulphate when given in full purgative doses
to cattle or sheep.</p>

<h2>ZINCI PHENOLSULPHONAS&mdash;ZINC SULPHOCARBOLATE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Zinc sulphocarbolate may be obtained
by heating a mixture of phenol and sulphuric acid and
saturating the product with zinc oxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Colorless, transparent, rhombic prisms
or tabular crystals; odorless and having an astringent,
metallic taste. Soluble in water and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 dr.; foals and
calves, 5 to 10 gr.; sheep and pigs, 20 to 40 gr.; dogs,
4 to 6 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Zinc sulphocarbolate has been
employed as an antiseptic astringent stimulant to indolent
or foul wounds, and in subacute inflammations of
the mucous membrane. The solution used may be a
little stronger than those of zinc sulphate employed for
similar purposes. It is also used as an intestinal antiseptic.</p>

<h3>ZINCI SULPHAS&mdash;ZINC SULPHATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Prepared by dissolving zinc in sulphuric
acid. Iron and tin exist as impurities and are
removed by chlorine solution and zinc carbonate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A colorless, transparent, rhombic
crystal, without odor and having an astringent, metallic
taste. Efflorescent in dry air; soluble in water and
glycerine; insoluble in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 dr.; sheep and pigs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
10 to 20 gr.; dogs, 2 to 3 gr. As an emetic for dogs,
10 to 15 gr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions.</span>&mdash;Irritant, emetic, astringent, antiseptic
and nerve tonic. Externally it is used as stimulant,
astringent and antiseptic; in dogs it is a prompt and
efficient emetic, causes no depression and acts both on
the stomach nerve centers; poisonous or long continued
large doses in the horse dry up the secretions, cause
nausea, colic and efforts to vomit; dogs cannot be poisoned
by it as it causes vomiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uses.</span>&mdash;As a tonic it is inferior to iron; chief use is
externally as an astringent; it is used in white lotion
combined with lead acetate; sometimes used internally
with opium to stop excessive sweating in frequent small
doses. Used as a safe and prompt emetic for dogs and
pigs.</p>

<p>Externally in solution as an astringent and stimulant
for wounds, ulcers, simple ophthalmia and irritable
conditions of the mucous membrane of the uterus or
vagina and urethra, vesicular and pustulant skin eruptions.
Proper strength, one ounce to one quart of water
in ophthalmia, one-half to one drachm to one pint
of water.</p>

<h3>ZINCI CARBONAS PRAECIPITATUS&mdash;PRECIPITATED
ZINC CARBONATE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Solutions of nearly equal weight of
sodium carbonate and zinc sulphate are boiled together;
dry precipitate. This salt is in reality a mixture of zinc
carbonate and oxide, in varying proportions, with water
of crystallization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;An impalpable white powder, of
somewhat variable chemical composition, without odor
or taste; insoluble in water or alcohol.</p>

<h3>ZINCI OXIDUM&mdash;ZINC OXIDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Zinc oxide, may be prepared by exposing
zinc carbonate to a dull red heat, or from metallic
zinc by combustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;An amorphous, white powder without
odor or taste. Insoluble in water or alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 dr.; sheep and
pigs, 10 to 20 gr.; dogs, 5 to 10 gr. Not much used internally.</p>

<h5>PREPARATIONS</h5>

<h4>UNGUENTUM ZINCI OXIDE&mdash;OINTMENT OF
ZINC OXIDE</h4>

<p>Composed of zinc oxide, 200 parts; benzoinated lard,
800 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actions and Uses.</span>&mdash;Used chiefly as a dusting powder
for wounds and excoriated surfaces; used alone or
conjoined with boric acid, subnitrate of bismuth, calomel
or in the form of the zinc oxide ointment is desiccant,
mildly astringent and protective; it is sometimes used in
chorea, epilepsy and other nervous diseases; to check
excessive sweating and in diarrhoea. Used extensively
in wounds and diseases of the cow’s udder.</p>

<h4>ZINCI ACETAS&mdash;ZINC ACETATE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Dissolve zinc oxide in diluted acetic
acid and boil. Evaporate and crystallize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;Soft, white, six-sided monoclinic plates,
of a pearly lustre, having a faintly acidious odor and an
astringent metallic taste. Soluble in water and in alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dose.</span>&mdash;Same as zinc sulphate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;The same as zinc sulphate; it is
the acetate of zinc which is the soluble agent in white
lotion, caused by the acetate of lead and sulphate of zinc
changing their composition.</p>

<h4>ZINCI CHLORIDUM&mdash;ZINC CHLORIDE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Dissolve zinc in hydrochloric acid by
boiling. The solution contains the zinc chloride with
chlorides of iron and lead as impurities. These are precipitated
by adding first nitric acid then zinc carbonate.
Filter and finally evaporate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A white, granular powder, or porcelain-like
masses, irregular or moulded into pencils; odorless;
of such intensely caustic properties as to make tasting
dangerous unless the salt be dissolved in much water,
when it has an astringent, metallic taste; very deliquescent;
soluble in water and alcohol.</p>

<h4>LIQUOR ZINCI CHLORIDE&mdash;SOLUTION OF
ZINC CHLORIDE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Derivation.</span>&mdash;Made from zinc chloride and water.
It should contain about 50 per cent, by weight, of the
salt. Zinc chloride is used externally only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;A clear, colorless, liquid, odorless,
having a very astringent, metallic taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action and Uses.</span>&mdash;Is caustic and escharotic, used
full strength or in a strong solution; penetrates very
deeply and causes deep sloughing; an irritant and corrosive
poison; mild medical solutions are antiseptic and
astringent; is also disinfectant and deodorizer. Can be
used as a caustic when indicated; used with caution, for
granulations in chronic ulcers and foot-rot in sheep; to
slough out all kinds of fistula, usually mixed with one or
two parts of flour made into a paste with water, two
ounces in a pint of water is injected as a caustic into
fistulous tracts; two or three per cent solution or two
to four drachms to the pint of water is used for ordinary
astringent purposes and as a parasiticide.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>Inconsistent, archaic and unusual spelling, hyphenation, capitalisation, etc. have been retained, except as mentioned below.
This includes the use of Linne for Linn&eacute;, atrophine for atropine, Qussia for Quassia, incontinuence for incontinence,
Reisling and Resiling for Riesling; Chichona and Cinchona; chlorid and chlorate for chloride, etc. that may either be deliberately used
alternative spellings or typographical errors.</p>

<p>Individual medicines have been treated as sections, which were (when applicable) grouped together in chapters based on their
common compound.</p>

<p>The book has several sentences where a word (or some words) may be missing; these have not been corrected, unless mentioned below.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all elements may display as intended.</p>

<p>Page 36, miscible with ether chloroform: presumably miscible with ether and chloroform.</p>

<p>Page 37, owe their flavor to bouquet to ethers: as printed in the source document; possibly an error for ... to a bouquet of ethers.</p>

<p>Page 41, 20 gr. to 1 dr.: the animal for this dose is not mentioned, but is possibly the dog.</p>

<p>Page 46, distillation of nitric and amylic alcohol: possibly an error for ... nitric acid and amylic alcohol.</p>

<p>Page 51, These four proportions of ammonia: possibly an error for These four preparations of ammonia; alcoholic proportions: possibly
an error for alcoholic preparations.</p>

<p>Page 85, 97, U. S.: presumably U. S. P. (for Pharmacopoeia) as elsewhere.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Changes:</p>

<p>Many minor obvious typographical errors have been corrected silently.</p>

<p>Aquous and aqueous have been standardised to aqueous; columba and calumba to calumba; hydrastic to hydrastis.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
